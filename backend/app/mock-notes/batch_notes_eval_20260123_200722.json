Noted that child is “chatty” but often hard to understand beyond family. No major changes since initial evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with brief hesitation, then engaged well with play-based activities. Required occasional redirection from preferred toys but responded to visual schedules and clear expectations. Participated in turn-taking games with support.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Establish production of /k/ in isolation and simple syllables (CV)\n- At baseline, child consistently fronted /k/ to /t/ in spontaneous speech (e.g., “tat” for “cat”).\n- With direct modeling and use of a “back sound” cue (touching throat, visual of tongue placement), child produced /k/ in isolation inconsistently. Able to achieve a clear /k/ in approximately half of imitated attempts with maximal verbal and visual cueing.\n- Briefly trialed /k/ in CV syllables (e.g., “koo,” “kah”); accuracy was low and required simultaneous production with clinician.\n\n2. Initial /f/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- Child often substituted /p/ for /f/ in conversation (e.g., “pish” for “fish”).\n- In structured imitation tasks, able to approximate /f/ with strong airflow when given “bite your lip and blow” cue and visual model. Accuracy higher in isolation than in syllables.\n- At word level (e.g., “fun,” “feet,” “fish”), productions were mostly stopped to /p/ even with cues; a few accurate productions emerged with very slow rate and repeated modeling.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Child produced /s/ in isolation with inconsistent airflow; some productions were lateral or reduced to /t/.\n- With mirror work and “snake sound” cue, able to produce a clearer /s/ intermittently, but needed ongoing reminders to keep tongue behind teeth.\n- Did not yet move into word-level /s/ this session due to focus on establishing consistent sound.\n\n4. Functional communication / phrase length (observation only)\n- During play, child used mostly 3–4 word utterances (e.g., “I want that one,” “my turn now”), but speech was often reduced in clarity due to sound errors and fast rate.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to target /k/ and /f/ in isolation and simple syllables with maximal support next session.\n- Introduce more structured CV and VC practice for /k/ and /f/ as tolerated.\n- Encourage caregiver to model slow, clear productions of words with /k/ and /f/ in daily routines without asking child to repeat every time (e.g., “keys,” “cup,” “fish,” “food”).\n- Plan to gather additional baseline data on /s/ blends in upcoming sessions once single sound /s/ stabilizes."

No notable changes in speech since last visit, though caregiver thinks /k/ is “a tiny bit better” in some practiced words.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated from caregiver more smoothly today and joined the therapist at the table with minimal prompting. Demonstrated good participation in turn-based games and was motivated by stickers and a simple board game. Attention to task was generally good with brief movement breaks.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. /k/ in CV and VC syllables (imitation)\n- Building on prior isolation work, child practiced /k/ in CV (e.g., “koo, kah, kee”) and VC (e.g., “ak, ik”).\n- With verbal cueing (“back sound”) and visual model, accuracy improved compared to last session. Child produced more consistent /k/ at the start and end of syllables with moderate cueing rather than maximal.\n- Noted some spontaneous self-correction attempts when fronting to /t/ (e.g., said “too,” paused, then attempted “koo” with support).\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word level (imitation)\n- Introduced simple /k/ initial words (e.g., “key, cow, car, cat”).\n- Child was able to imitate several words with a recognizable /k/ when given a slowed model and occasional tactile cue (light touch to throat/under chin to cue “back” sound).\n- Errors included fronting to /t/ or omitting the initial consonant; however, accurate productions were more frequent than at baseline, indicating emerging word-level skills.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on /f/ in isolation with “bite your lip and blow” cue. Child showed clearer, more consistent airflow compared to previous session.\n- Practiced CV syllables (“foo, faa, fee”); able to maintain /f/ in initial position in about half of imitated attempts with moderate cueing.\n- Word-level practice remained challenging, with frequent /p/ substitutions, but there were a few clearer approximations when rate was slowed and visual attention to the clinician’s mouth was encouraged.\n\n4. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Child showed slightly more consistent /s/ in isolation with visual feedback in the mirror.\n- Trialed /s/ in CV combinations (e.g., “soo, see”). Productions varied between accurate /s/, /sh/, and /t/. Verbal reminders to “keep tongue behind teeth” were somewhat helpful, but the sound is still emerging.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen /k/ at the word level in imitation; if consistency continues to improve, consider introducing a small set of functional /k/ words for use in simple phrases.\n- Maintain focus on /f/ in isolation and syllables; delay heavy word-level demands until accuracy is more stable.\n- Continue shaping /s/ in isolation with mirror work and airflow cues.\n- Caregiver encouraged to play short “sound games” at home, focusing on making long /k/ and /f/ sounds together in a playful way rather than drilling words."

They feel others still have difficulty understanding the child in conversation. No new concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered session happily and was eager to show a toy car from home. Participated well in both floor play and table tasks. Needed occasional prompts to stay seated during drill activities, but returned to tasks with gentle reminders.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Initial /k/ at word level (imitation → supported spontaneous)\n- Practiced a set of familiar /k/ words (“car, cat, key, cookie, coat”) using pictures and toy items.\n- Child imitated /k/ initial words with noticeably improved accuracy compared to last week, often needing only a brief visual model and occasional verbal cue.\n- Began to use some /k/ words spontaneously in structured play (e.g., saying “car go” while moving the toy car), though consistency in spontaneous use is still emerging.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in 2–3 word phrases (imitation)\n- Introduced short carrier phrases (e.g., “my car,” “big cat,” “go car”) at the imitated phrase level.\n- With moderate cueing for the initial /k/, child produced several phrases with a clear /k/ in at least one of multiple trials. Some blends of /t/ and /k/ were observed, but overall clarity was better than at the single-word level during earlier sessions.\n\n3. Initial /f/ at word level (imitation)\n- Moved into imitated word-level practice for /f/ (“fish, fun, feet, five”) while continuing to use the “bite lip and blow” cue.\n- Compared to previous sessions, child demonstrated a more stable /f/ in isolation and was able to carry this over to word-initial position in a meaningful number of attempts.\n- Errors still included /p/ substitutions, especially when speech rate increased, but there were clear, accurate productions in structured practice.\n\n4. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued shaping /s/ with mirror feedback. Child produced a few sustained, fairly accurate /s/ sounds with verbal reminders.\n- CV syllables (e.g., “see, soo”) remained inconsistent, with frequent shifts to /sh/ or /t/. However, child showed better awareness of tongue placement and was able to correct with immediate modeling.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Given progress, continue to expand /k/ practice at the phrase level with strong visual supports and play-based routines.\n- Maintain /f/ at the imitated word level, aiming for more consistent accuracy before moving to phrases.\n- Continue to focus on establishing a reliable /s/ sound in isolation; defer /s/ word-level goals until production is more stable.\n- Caregiver encouraged to model short phrases with target /k/ words at home (e.g., “my car,” “big cookie”) and praise any clear /k/ attempts."

No new medical or developmental concerns reported.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned smoothly into the therapy room and engaged quickly with a car and animal play set. Attention was generally good; needed brief breaks between structured drill sets. Demonstrated good rapport with clinician and responded well to visual timers.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Initial /k/ in 2–3 word phrases (imitation → reduced cues)\n- Continued practice of phrases such as “my car,” “go car,” “big cat,” “cookie please.”\n- Compared to last week, child required fewer prompts to produce /k/ accurately within phrases. Often a single model or reminder (“back sound”) was sufficient.\n- Accuracy in imitated phrases was noticeably higher, and there were more spontaneous attempts during play (e.g., “my car” without a model), though still not fully consistent.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in simple sentences (imitation)\n- Introduced short sentences (e.g., “The car is big,” “I see a cat”) at the imitated level.\n- With moderate cueing, child produced /k/ clearly in many attempts, though accuracy decreased as sentence length increased. Some omissions and fronting persisted, but the child was able to repair after a model.\n\n3. Initial /f/ at word level and emerging phrases\n- Practiced /f/ initial words (“fish, fun, four, feet”) using picture cards and a fishing game.\n- Accuracy in imitated words improved from prior sessions, with more consistent /f/ rather than /p/ when rate was controlled and child watched the clinician’s mouth.\n- Trialed short phrases (e.g., “four fish,” “fun food”) with mixed success. Child could sometimes maintain /f/ at the start of the first word but often reverted to /p/ in connected speech.\n\n4. /s/ in isolation and initial word probes\n- Continued isolation practice for /s/ using mirror and “long snake sound” cue. Child showed better control of airflow and tongue placement.\n- Briefly probed initial /s/ words (e.g., “sun, sock, soup”) at the imitated level. Productions were variable, including /t/, /sh/, and some approximations of /s/. This will remain a secondary focus while /k/ and /f/ continue to develop.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen /k/ at the phrase and short sentence levels, gradually fading cues as tolerated.\n- Maintain /f/ at the word level while gently increasing phrase-level opportunities in structured play.\n- Keep /s/ primarily at isolation with occasional word-level probes to monitor readiness.\n- Caregiver encouraged to model and emphasize /f/ words during daily routines (e.g., “feet, food, fun”) and to praise child’s attempts, without overcorrecting."

Maintained attention for longer drill sets than previous weeks, with minimal need for redirection. Demonstrated good turn-taking and followed simple game rules with support.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Initial /k/ in short sentences and structured play (imitation → emerging spontaneous)\n- Continued work on short sentences with /k/ words (e.g., “The car is fast,” “I see a cat,” “My cookie is big”).\n- Child showed more consistent accuracy in imitated sentences and required fewer explicit cues for /k/. Often produced /k/ correctly after a single model.\n- During car and animal play, child spontaneously produced some /k/ words and short phrases (e.g., “big car,” “my cat”) with clearer /k/ than previously noted, though not yet across all opportunities.\n\n2. Initial /f/ at word and simple phrase level\n- Practiced /f/ words (“fish, four, fun, feet, food”) using a fishing game and snack-themed pictures.\n- Accuracy at the imitated word level increased compared to last session, with more reliable use of lip-biting and airflow.\n- Introduced simple 2-word phrases (e.g., “four fish,” “fun food,” “big feet”). Child was able to maintain /f/ at the start of some words with verbal reminders, but still occasionally substituted /p/, particularly when speaking quickly.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued focus on isolation /s/ with mirror and visual supports. Child produced several clear /s/ sounds in a row with clinician modeling.\n- Practiced CV syllables (“see, soo, say”) with variable accuracy. Some productions were closer to target /s/, while others shifted to /sh/ or /t/. Child showed increased awareness of tongue position and was willing to adjust after feedback.\n\n4. Functional phrase length and intelligibility in play\n- During spontaneous play, child used 3–4 word utterances (e.g., “I want the big car,” “my turn now”). Overall intelligibility was slightly improved compared to earlier sessions when talking about practiced /k/ and /f/ words, though speech remained less clear in unpracticed vocabulary.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on /k/ in short sentences and structured play, encouraging more spontaneous use of practiced /k/ words.\n- Maintain /f/ practice at the word level with ongoing introduction of simple phrases; continue to support accurate lip and airflow patterns.\n- Keep building consistency for /s/ in isolation and simple syllables; word-level /s/ will remain limited to probes.\n- Caregiver encouraged to notice and praise spontaneous clear /k/ and /f/ productions at home and to model short, slow sentences containing these targets."

No concerns about hearing or health.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered eagerly and requested specific toys. Demonstrated strong engagement with both play-based and structured tasks. Tolerated slightly longer practice sets and responded well to specific praise for effort and accuracy.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Initial /k/ in sentences and early conversational contexts\n- Continued practice with short sentences containing /k/ (e.g., “I see a cookie,” “The car is red,” “The cat is sleeping”).\n- Compared to last week, child needed fewer direct cues and often produced /k/ correctly in the first attempt during imitation.\n- In semi-structured conversation about favorite foods and toys, child produced several /k/ words with a clear back sound without being prompted (e.g., “cookie,” “cake,” “car”). These spontaneous productions represented a noticeable increase in independence.\n\n2. Initial /f/ at word and 2–3 word phrase levels\n- Practiced /f/ words and short phrases (“four fish,” “fun food,” “big feet,” “find it”) in a game format.\n- Accuracy at the imitated word level continued to improve, and the child required fewer reminders to bite the lip.\n- Phrases were more successful today, with more consistent /f/ in at least one of the target words per phrase. Occasional /p/ substitutions persisted, especially when excited, but the child frequently attempted to self-correct after feedback.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation, CV syllables, and limited word probes\n- Child demonstrated more stable /s/ in isolation, able to hold a “long snake sound” for several seconds with correct tongue placement.\n- CV syllables (“see, soo, say, suh”) were more accurate than previous sessions, though some productions still shifted to /sh/.\n- Briefly probed initial /s/ words (“sun, sock, soup, sit”) at the imitated level. Several approximations were close to target /s/, indicating readiness to begin more consistent word-level practice soon.\n\n4.

Caregiver is interested in working more on /s/ now that /k/ seems stronger.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child arrived in good spirits and transitioned quickly. Very engaged with a board game and pretend restaurant play. Demonstrated increased tolerance for corrective feedback and actively asked, “Did I do it?” after some attempts.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Initial /k/ in spontaneous sentences and conversation\n- Shifted focus from primarily imitated sentences to more natural, child-led conversation involving /k/ words (e.g., talking about cookies, cake, cars, and “going to the park”).\n- Child produced many /k/ initial words accurately in spontaneous sentences with minimal or no cueing. Occasional fronting to /t/ occurred, but the child often self-corrected after a brief look from the clinician or a gentle reminder.\n- Given the high level of independence and consistency observed today, /k/ is approaching conversational-level generalization for a core set of familiar words.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in short sentences and structured conversation\n- Expanded /f/ practice to short sentences (e.g., “Four fish swim,” “I see food,” “My feet are big”) during a fishing and restaurant game.\n- Compared to previous sessions, child maintained /f/ more consistently across both words and short phrases, with fewer /p/ substitutions.\n- In semi-structured conversation about favorite foods and family, several spontaneous /f/ words were produced with clearer lip posture (e.g., “five,” “food,” “four”). Some errors remained, but overall independence improved.\n\n3. Initial /s/ at word level (imitation) with continued isolation practice\n- Built on improved isolation skills to target initial /s/ words (“sun, sock, soup, seat, soap”) at the imitated word level.\n- Child was able to produce several clear /s/ initial words when given a model and reminder to “keep tongue behind teeth.” Accuracy was higher than during earlier probes and improved over the course of the activity.\n- Continued brief isolation practice between word trials to reset tongue placement, which helped maintain accuracy.\n\n4.

            "note_text": "Parent report:\n- Caregiver reported that speech “feels pretty steady” compared to the last few weeks. They are pleased with how clear /k/ has become and note gradual, but not dramatic, changes for /f/ and /s/.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child arrived in a positive mood and participated well in familiar routines and games. Attention, cooperation, and response to feedback were consistent with recent sessions.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. /k/ in conversational speech (maintenance)\n- /k/ remained strong and generally accurate across spontaneous conversation. The child used many /k/ initial words (e.g., “cookie, car, cake, coat”) clearly without direct cueing.\n- Occasional fronting was rare and typically self-corrected with minimal support.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in sentences and structured play\n- Practiced /f/ initial words and short sentences in games and picture description (e.g., “Four frogs jump,” “I feed the fish,” “My feet are wet”).\n- Performance was comparable to prior weeks: several accurate /f/ productions with visual/verbal cues, interspersed with /p/ substitutions, particularly during faster or less structured speech.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in imitated words and simple phrases\n- Continued focus on initial /s/ words and short phrases in imitation (e.g., “sun up,” “sock on,” “soap bubbles”).\n- Accuracy and cueing needs remained similar to previous sessions. Child produced some clear /s/ words when attention was high, but consistency across trials is still developing.\n\n4. Overall intelligibility and summary of block\n- In structured play and conversation, child’s intelligibility is noticeably better than at the start of the block, particularly for /k/ initial words and, to a lesser extent, for /f/.\n- /k/ has largely generalized to conversational speech for a functional set of words, while /f/ and /s/ are showing emerging but inconsistent improvements.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to monitor /k/ in conversation in future sessions, with less direct drill needed unless regression is observed.\n- Ongoing focus on /f/ and /s/ at the current complexity level, aiming for greater consistency before moving into more spontaneous and phrase-level /s/ work.\n- Caregiver encouraged to maintain short, daily practice focusing on a few target /f/ and /s/ words, to praise self-corrections, and to model slow, clear speech during shared activities.\n- Consider re-evaluating goal hierarchy in upcoming block to reflect strong /k/ progress and continued needs for /f/ and /s/."

            "note_text": "Session 1\n\nParent/Caregiver Report:\n- Mother reported that intelligibility is \"hit or miss\" at home, especially when her child is excited. She notices many words without ending sounds and difficulty with /s/ and /f/ in everyday speech. No recent changes in health or hearing.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child transitioned into the therapy room with some hesitation but joined play after a brief warm-up. Generally cooperative with turn-taking games. Attention was best during highly motivating toy activities; needed occasional redirection when tasks became more structured.\n\nGoals / Therapy Activities:\n1. Establish accurate production of /f/ in isolation\n   - Introduced /f/ as the \"lip-bite, quiet air\" sound using mirror and visual cueing. Child was able to approximate /f/ in isolation with maximal verbal and visual prompts. Accuracy was inconsistent; often substituted /p/ or used a prolonged /h/ instead of continuous airflow. Able to achieve a few clear /f/ productions when slowed down and reminded to \"bite lip, blow.\"\n\n2. Initial /f/ in CV and VC syllables (e.g., \"fa,\" \"foo,\" \"if\")\n   - At the imitated syllable level, child required direct models and repeated practice. Productions frequently reduced to /p/ or omitted the consonant. A few accurate productions were observed when pairing with hand cues for airflow. Not yet ready to move to word-level without significant support.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple CV syllables\n   - Modeled /s/ as the \"snake sound\" with tongue placement cues. Child could sometimes generate a prolonged /s/ in isolation with maximal support, but often produced /t/ or /sh/ instead. In CV syllables, consonant was usually omitted or distorted. Tolerated tactile and gestural cueing around the mouth.\n\n4. Final consonant awareness in CVC words during play\n   - Used picture cards and toys to highlight final sounds in high-interest words (e.g., \"cup,\" \"dog,\" \"bus\"). Child frequently omitted final consonants in spontaneous speech. With imitation and focused listening tasks, could sometimes add a final /p/ or /m/, though productions were not yet consistent.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to focus on establishing consistent /f/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables before advancing to word level.\n- Encourage parent to model slow, clear productions at home and to highlight /f/ and /s/ sounds in familiar words (e.g., \"fish,\" \"sun\") without asking for repeated corrections.\n- Next session will revisit /f/ and /s/ isolation and CV/VC syllables, and continue to monitor final consonant production in play."

She feels the child is \"trying more\" but still not using the sound clearly in everyday words. No other concerns reported.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child separated from caregiver more easily this week and engaged quickly with preferred toys. Participated well in structured tasks for short bursts, then needed movement breaks. Responded positively to praise and visual stickers.\n\nGoals / Therapy Activities:\n1. /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n   - Notable improvement from last week. Child produced /f/ in isolation with moderate verbal and visual cues in most attempts. Fewer substitutions of /p/. In CV syllables (\"fee,\" \"fo,\" \"fa\"), accuracy was higher with slow modeling; child could imitate several clear productions in a row before fatigue. Still needed reminders to maintain airflow.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in single words (imitation)\n   - Trialed simple words (e.g., \"fish,\" \"fan,\" \"foot\") at the imitated word level. Child achieved some accurate productions, though consistency was variable. Tended to revert to /p/ when speaking more quickly (\"pish\" for \"fish\"). With segmenting and backward chaining (e.g., \"ish\" → \"fish\"), could correct with support. Emerging readiness to work at word level.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and simple syllables\n   - Continued work on tongue placement using mirror and \"snake sound\" visual. Child showed more frequent successful /s/ productions in isolation with moderate cueing. In CV syllables (\"see,\" \"soo\"), still some distortion but fewer /t/ substitutions. Required cues to keep tongue behind teeth.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)\n   - Practiced final /p, m, t/ in simple CVC words (\"cup,\" \"mom,\" \"hat\") using picture cards. Child imitated several final consonants when directly prompted, with improved awareness compared to last week. Omission remained common in spontaneous play, but attempts to add endings were observed when cued.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen /f/ production at the word level with imitation, while maintaining isolation and syllable practice for carryover.\n- Maintain focus on /s/ isolation and CV syllables before moving to consistent word-level practice.\n- Encourage parent to play short \"sound games\" at home (e.g., finding objects that start with /f/) and to praise attempts rather than perfection."

She still notices dropped endings in many words but feels the child is \"trying to fix\" some sounds.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child entered the room independently and quickly gravitated toward a construction toy. Very engaged when therapy tasks were embedded into play. Needed occasional prompts to stay on topic but overall participation was good.\n\nGoals / Therapy Activities:\n1. Initial /f/ in single words (imitation → emerging spontaneous)\n   - Targeted initial /f/ words (\"fish, fan, feet, five, food\") in a picture and game format. Child produced initial /f/ accurately in imitation much of the time with only light reminders to bite the lip. During structured play, began to produce some target words spontaneously with recognizable /f/ (e.g., \"fish\" without a model). Fewer /p/ substitutions compared to last week.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in simple carrier phrases\n   - Introduced short phrases such as \"my fish,\" \"big fan,\" and \"two feet\" using modeling and then faded supports. Child could imitate phrases with fairly clear /f/ when provided with a model. Independence at the phrase level is emerging but still variable.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and CV syllables; initial /s/ in word-level imitation\n   - Child continued to show improved ability to sustain /s/ in isolation with moderate cues. Practiced CV syllables (\"see, soo, suh\"); accuracy better for \"see\" and \"soo\" than for \"suh.\" Trialed a small set of initial /s/ words in imitation (\"sun, soup, sock\"). Productions were inconsistently accurate, with some /t/ substitutions and distorted /s/. Required visual and verbal cues for correct tongue placement.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)\n   - Revisited final /p, m, t/ in CVC words using a turn-taking board game. Child more consistently added final /p/ and /m/ when directly imitating. Final /t/ remained more challenging, with occasional \"tuh\" additions. Still minimal carryover into spontaneous speech.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to build consistency with initial /f/ at the word level and expand short carrier phrases.\n- Maintain practice with /s/ in isolation and syllables, gradually increasing the number of initial /s/ words in imitation.\n- Encourage parent to highlight and praise any clear /f/ words at home and to model simple two-word phrases with /f/ (e.g., \"fun food\")."

She has not yet noticed much change in the /s/ sound. No new concerns.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child was cheerful and eager to show toys brought from home. Participated well in both play-based and table-top activities with brief movement breaks. Responded well to visual schedules and verbal praise.\n\nGoals / Therapy Activities:\n1. Initial /f/ in single words and short phrases\n   - Child demonstrated increasing consistency with initial /f/ at the imitated word level. Words such as \"fish, fan, feet, fork, food\" were produced clearly most of the time with minimal cues. In short phrases (\"my fish,\" \"big fork,\" \"two feet\"), the child could imitate accurately and, during play, began to independently produce some phrases containing /f/ with recognizable clarity. Occasional reversion to /p/ occurred when speaking quickly.\n\n2. /f/ in mixed positions at word level (emerging)\n   - Introduced some final /f/ words (\"off,\" \"leaf\") and medial /f/ (\"sofa\") in imitation. Child was able to approximate the sound but with less consistency than initial position. Required more direct modeling and slow pacing.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation, syllables, and limited word practice\n   - Continued work on sustained /s/ in isolation; child now requires fewer prompts to maintain airflow. Practiced CV syllables and a small set of initial /s/ words (\"sun, soup, sock, sand\"). Accuracy at the imitated word level showed slight improvement: fewer /t/ substitutions, though distortions still present. Child responded to cues to keep tongue behind teeth and lips slightly apart.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation and listening tasks)\n   - Reinforced awareness of final sounds with listening games (\"Do you hear the end?\"), followed by imitation of CVC words with /p, m, t/. Child showed similar performance to last week: more consistent with final /p/ and /m/, variable with /t/. Continued omission of final consonants in spontaneous utterances.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to consolidate /f/ in initial position at word and short phrase levels, while gradually adding more words with /f/ in other positions.\n- Maintain a small, functional set of /s/ words for practice and focus on improving accuracy through consistent tongue placement cues.\n- Parent encouraged to model and expand phrases that include /f/ (e.g., \"funny fish,\" \"five feet\"), and to gently repeat child’s /s/ words with correct models without pressure to imitate every time."

Attention span for structured tasks was slightly longer today, with fewer prompts needed to stay engaged. Enjoyed turn-taking and simple competitive games.\n\nGoals / Therapy Activities:\n1. Initial /f/ in words and carrier phrases (imitation → increased independence)\n   - Child produced initial /f/ with good consistency across a wider variety of words (\"fish, fan, fun, fork, feet, food\"). Accuracy remained high in imitation and is improving in short carrier phrases (\"I see fish,\" \"my fun fork\"). Some independent phrase-level productions were observed during play with only minimal cueing.\n\n2. /f/ in mixed positions at word level\n   - Continued practice with final and medial /f/ (\"off, leaf, coffee\"). Child could imitate these with moderate success but required extra time to coordinate the final position. Tendency to drop the final /f/ when speaking quickly (e.g., \"lea\" for \"leaf\").\n\n3. Initial /s/ in CV syllables and simple words (imitation)\n   - Practiced CV syllables (\"see, soo, say\") and initial /s/ words (\"sun, soup, sock, soap\"). Slight increase in accuracy compared to prior sessions. Still some distortions and occasional /t/ substitutions, but the child responded to reminders to keep the tongue \"behind the teeth\" and to \"make quiet air.\" Consistency is slowly improving but remains variable.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)\n   - Revisited final /p, m, t/ using picture cards and a simple board game. Performance was similar to previous sessions: child could add final consonants in imitation in many trials, especially /p/ and /m/, but carryover into unstructured speech remains limited.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to consolidate /f/ in initial position across more words and phrases, with ongoing practice in other word positions.\n- Maintain focus on initial /s/ at the syllable and word levels with clear visual and verbal placement cues.\n- Encourage parent to notice and praise clear /f/ words, and to model final consonants by slightly emphasizing them in key words (e.g., \"cuP,\" \"haT\") without asking for constant repetitions."

Participation in structured tasks was adequate, though more frequent breaks were needed. Cooperative and responsive to gentle redirection.\n\nGoals / Therapy Activities:\n1. Initial /f/ in words and short phrases\n   - Performance remained generally stable relative to last week. Child continued to produce initial /f/ in a variety of words with good accuracy in imitation and moderate accuracy in short phrases. Occasional /p/ substitutions persisted when speaking quickly or when attention waned, but overall clarity for /f/ was maintained.\n\n2. /f/ in mixed positions at word level\n   - Practiced final and medial /f/ words (\"off, leaf, coffee, muffin\"). Accuracy was similar to prior session: child often produced clear /f/ in imitation when given time, but final /f/ was still frequently omitted in spontaneous attempts. No major change in cueing level was observed.\n\n3.

Demonstrated good turn-taking and enjoyed being the \"teacher\" to help the clinician \"practice\" sounds. Needed minimal redirection today.\n\nGoals / Therapy Activities:\n1. Initial /f/ in words and short phrases (increased independence)\n   - Child showed more spontaneous use of clear /f/ during play (\"fish,\" \"food,\" \"four,\" \"five\") with fewer substitutions. At the phrase level (\"my fish,\" \"four feet,\" \"big food\"), the child produced /f/ more independently, often needing only a brief reminder or visual cue. Emerging self-corrections were observed when the child initially produced /p/.\n\n2. /f/ in mixed positions at word level\n   - Continued practice with medial and final /f/ (\"sofa, coffee, leaf, off\"). The child showed slightly better consistency, particularly for final /f/ in imitation. Still more challenging than initial position, but improvement was noted in the child’s ability to maintain airflow at the end of words.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in syllables and simple words (imitation → emerging independence)\n   - Practiced CV syllables and a familiar set of /s/ words (\"sun, soup, sock, seal, sand\"). Accuracy improved compared to previous weeks, with more consistently recognizable /s/ productions and fewer /t/ substitutions. The child occasionally produced a clearer /s/ word spontaneously during play (e.g., \"sun\") without direct prompting. Still benefits from visual and verbal cues, but less intensive cueing was required overall.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)\n   - Targeted final /p, m, t/ in game-based activities. The child continued to show better success with /p/ and /m/, with a slight increase in accurate /t/ endings when provided with a gesture cue. Final consonant omissions in spontaneous speech remained frequent but some attempts to add final sounds were noted.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen independence with /f/ at word and short phrase levels, and gradually increase variety of /f/ words in different positions.\n- Maintain focused practice on initial /s/ with an emphasis on building consistency and encouraging self-monitoring.\n- Parent encouraged to point out and praise moments when the child corrects their own sounds and to keep modeling clear /s/ in daily routines."

She has heard a few better /s/ words (\"sun,\" \"sock\") without reminders. She is interested in ways to help at the sentence level.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child entered the room enthusiastically and remained engaged throughout the session. Able to follow multi-step directions in play and was motivated by earning small rewards. Demonstrated good persistence even when tasks were more challenging.\n\nGoals / Therapy Activities:\n1. /f/ in sentences and structured conversation\n   - Expanded from short phrases to simple sentences containing /f/ (e.g., \"I see a fish,\" \"The food is hot,\" \"Four funny frogs\"). Child produced /f/ with high accuracy in imitation and increasing independence when retelling short stories or describing pictures. Spontaneous use of /f/ in connected speech during play was clear in many instances, with only occasional /p/ substitutions.\n\n2. /f/ in mixed word positions within phrases\n   - Practiced phrases and short sentences with /f/ in initial, medial, and final positions (\"soft leaf,\" \"big coffee cup,\" \"take it off\"). Child handled initial /f/ with minimal support; medial and final /f/ remained slightly less consistent but showed improvement. Able to maintain airflow better at the end of words when cued to \"keep the air going.\"\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases (imitation → early spontaneous use)\n   - Targeted initial /s/ words (\"sun, soup, sock, sand, seal, soap\") in games and picture tasks. Accuracy at the imitated word level was notably better than earlier sessions, with more consistent /s/ productions. Introduced short carrier phrases (\"my sun,\" \"see sock\"). Child could imitate these phrases with fair accuracy and occasionally produced clear /s/ words spontaneously during play. Still benefits from reminders about tongue placement, but overall cueing demands were reduced.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words and short phrases (imitation)\n   - Continued work on final /p, m, t/ in CVC words and short phrases (\"big cup,\" \"my mom,\" \"red hat\"). Child showed gradual improvement, particularly when words were practiced repeatedly in a meaningful context. However, omissions in spontaneous speech remained common, suggesting ongoing need for structured practice.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to expand /f/ into more complex sentences and monitor generalization into less structured conversation.\n- Maintain a targeted set of /s/ words and phrases, gradually increasing phrase complexity as accuracy stabilizes.\n- Parent encouraged to use simple picture books or routines (e.g., snack time) to elicit short sentences with /f/ and to gently model clearer /s/ in familiar /s/ words."

No new concerns.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child remained cooperative and chatty throughout the session. Needed a brief movement break midway but quickly re-engaged with tasks. Enjoyed being given choices about which pictures and games to use.\n\nGoals / Therapy Activities:\n1. /f/ in sentences and conversation\n   - Performance remained stable with good accuracy for /f/ in sentences and structured conversation. Child produced /f/ correctly in a variety of contexts with minimal to no cueing. Occasional errors occurred when speaking very quickly, but the child was usually understood.\n\n2. /f/ in mixed positions across phrases\n   - Continued to practice /f/ in initial, medial, and final positions within short sentences. Accuracy was consistent with previous session; child required minimal reminders for final /f/. No notable change in cueing needs this week.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases\n   - Revisited the same core /s/ words and short phrases (\"sun, soup, sock, seal, sand\"; \"my sun,\" \"see sock\"). Accuracy was similar to last week: child produced more correct /s/ sounds in imitation and some spontaneous words, but consistency varied. Visual and verbal cues were still helpful, particularly when the child became excited.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words and phrases\n   - Practiced final /p, m, t/ in play (e.g., feeding animals \"cup,\" \"ham,\" \"hat\"). Child continued to show improving awareness but still omitted final sounds frequently in spontaneous speech. Performance at the imitated level was comparable to the prior session.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Maintain current level of practice for /f/ to support generalization and monitor for continued stability.\n- Continue structured work on initial /s/ and final consonants, allowing more time for these skills to consolidate.\n- Parent encouraged to keep noticing and reinforcing clear /f/ and /s/ productions and to provide gentle models for final consonants without high pressure."

She feels /s/ and word endings are \"about the same\" as last week. Child recently started a new preschool routine; no concerns reported from teachers yet.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child initially talked a lot about preschool but settled into therapy tasks with minimal support. Remained engaged in both table-top and floor activities. Showed good willingness to attempt harder words when encouraged.\n\nGoals / Therapy Activities:\n1. /f/ in sentences and conversation\n   - Continued practice of /f/ in connected speech. Child maintained high accuracy with /f/ across initial, medial, and final positions in sentences. Very little cueing was required, and errors were infrequent. Performance remained stable.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases\n   - Practiced a familiar set of /s/ words and added a few new ones (\"sun, soup, sock, seal, sand, soap, seat\"). The child showed similar accuracy to the previous session, with some correct productions and some distortions or substitutions. Cueing level remained about the same; visual and verbal reminders continued to be beneficial.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in structured play (emerging spontaneous use)\n   - Embedded /s/ targets into a pretend play scenario (e.g., setting up a \"sand\" area, washing with \"soap\"). Child produced a few clearer /s/ words spontaneously but also reverted to less accurate productions. No significant shift in independence was noted this week.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words\n   - Continued with CVC words and short phrases emphasizing final /p, m, t/. The child’s performance was comparable to recent sessions: increased success with final consonants in imitation, but spontaneous use of final sounds remained limited. No major change in overall pattern.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on consolidating /s/ at word and short phrase levels while continuing to monitor stable /f/ skills.\n- Continue final consonant work in highly functional words that are relevant at preschool (e.g., \"hat,\" \"cup,\" \"bus\").\n- Parent encouraged to check in with preschool staff about any intelligibility concerns and to share strategies (e.g., slowing down, repeating key words) if needed."

They also occasionally notice unclear /s/ sounds. Mother feels skills are \"holding steady\" since last week.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child came in with good energy and quickly engaged in pretend play. Cooperative throughout the session with only brief redirection needed. Enjoyed using a mirror to \"watch\" sounds.\n\nGoals / Therapy Activities:\n1. /f/ in conversation and carryover tasks\n   - Used open-ended conversation and picture description tasks. Child continued to produce /f/ accurately in most contexts without cues. Occasional slips occurred but did not significantly affect intelligibility. Performance stable compared to prior weeks.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases\n   - Practiced a mix of familiar and new /s/ words (\"sun, soup, sock, seal, sand, seat, soup, sad\"). Accuracy remained similar to the last session. Child responded well when reminded to place the tongue \"behind the teeth,\" but still needed these cues fairly often. Phrase-level accuracy (\"my sock,\" \"see sun\") was variable.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in structured play\n   - Embedded /s/ targets into a board game and pretend play. Child produced some spontaneous /s/ words with clearer articulation, but these were interspersed with less accurate productions. Overall level of independence was consistent with recent weeks.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words and short phrases\n   - Continued focus on final /p, m, t/ in high-frequency words. Child could produce final consonants reliably in imitation within structured tasks but omitted them more frequently when shifting to brief phrases or unstructured play. Error patterns and cueing needs were stable.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue with current targets, emphasizing consistent placement cues for /s/ and gradual increase in phrase-level practice.\n- Maintain collaboration with preschool staff to support carryover (e.g., modeling clear /s/ and final sounds during small group activities).\n- Parent encouraged to continue brief, fun practice at home and to reinforce when the child uses clearer /s/ or final consonants in everyday situations."

She notes that /s/ and final consonants are still \"a work in progress\" but feels the child is more aware of sounds. No new concerns.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child was relaxed and talkative, transitioning easily into therapy activities. Participated well in both structured and play-based tasks. Demonstrated good rapport with the clinician and responded well to feedback.\n\nGoals / Therapy Activities:\n1. Review of /f/ across word positions in conversation\n   - Conducted a review of /f/ in initial, medial, and final positions during picture description and conversational tasks. Child maintained strong accuracy for /f/ with minimal cueing required. Occasional errors were self-corrected. This skill appears well established at this time.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases\n   - Revisited core /s/ words and short phrases (\"sun, soup, sock, seal, sand,\" \"see sun,\" \"my sock\"). Performance was consistent with recent sessions: a mix of accurate and distorted /s/ productions, with better accuracy when the child was attentive and used placement cues. Still needs regular reminders for tongue position but is increasingly tolerant of cueing.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in simple sentences (imitation)\n   - Introduced short sentences with /s/ in initial position (e.g., \"The sun is hot,\" \"I see soup\"). Child could imitate these sentences with fair accuracy when provided with a clear model and slowed rate. Independence at the sentence level is not yet established, but the child managed several recognizable productions.\n\n4. Final consonant production in functional CVC words\n   - Targeted final /p, m, t/ in functional words used at home and preschool (\"cup, nap, mom, game, hat, seat\"). In imitation, the child produced many accurate final consonants. Spontaneous carryover remains limited but awareness of final sounds appears improved, as the child occasionally attempted to \"add the end\" when cued.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Recommend continued therapy to further develop /s/ accuracy and final consonant production, with a focus on increasing independence at the phrase and sentence levels.\n- Provide parent with a short list of high-frequency /s/ words and CVC words with final consonants for home practice, emphasizing brief, positive practice times.\n- Plan next block to prioritize /s/ refinement and final consonant carryover, while monitoring maintenance of strong /f/ skills in connected speech."

No major concerns reported this week aside from others occasionally having difficulty understanding the child.\n- Parent noted that the child is very talkative at home and uses short sentences (3–4 words).\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned into the therapy room with some initial hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance.\n- Once engaged with toys, the child was cheerful and cooperative. Attention to adult-directed tasks was variable; required frequent redirection from self-directed play back to speech activities.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Establish production of /s/ in isolation\n- Introduced \"snake sound\" and visual cue (smiling lips, teeth together, long air). With maximal verbal and visual cues, the child was able to sustain /s/ intermittently but often added a vowel (e.g., \"suh\").\n- Accuracy for clear, isolated /s/ remained low; productions were inconsistent and often backed or distorted.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in CV and VC syllables\n- Practiced syllables such as \"see, soo, ess, iss\" at the imitation level. Child required frequent modeling and visual cueing.\n- Some approximations were heard, but the child often substituted /t/ or omitted the sound entirely.\n\n3. Establish production of /f/ in isolation\n- Introduced \"bunny teeth on lip\" cue with mirror. Child was able to place the lower lip under the top teeth with hand-over-hand support.\n- Airflow was inconsistent; often produced a stop-like sound (/p/). A few clearer /f/ sounds were heard when the clinician slowed the pace and exaggerated the model.\n\n4. Functional communication observation\n- During play, child produced many spontaneous short phrases (e.g., \"my turn,\" \"I want that,\" \"go car\"). Intelligibility was reduced at times due to sound substitutions and omissions, especially in initial position.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build awareness of /s/ and /f/ at the isolation and simple syllable levels with heavy cueing.\n- Encourage caregiver to model slow, clear \"snake\" (/s/) and \"bunny teeth\" (/f/) sounds during daily routines without pressure to copy.\n- Plan to continue at the sound and simple syllable level next session before moving to words."

Initial /s/ at word and phrase levels (increased independence)\n- Child produced familiar /s/ words in imitation with high accuracy and needed only occasional verbal reminders.\n- In short phrases (\"see sun,\" \"my sock,\" \"more soup\"), the child imitated with good consistency and was able to produce some phrases independently with acceptable /s/ productions.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in structured play and early conversation\n- During a pretend play routine (kitchen set, toy animals), the clinician embedded /s/ words and encouraged the child to use them spontaneously.\n- The child produced several independent /s/ words accurately within play (e.g., \"soup,\" \"sunny,\" \"sit\") and occasionally used the \"snake sound\" without prompting.\n\n3. /f/ in isolation, CV syllables, and initial word attempts (imitation)\n- Child showed improved stability in /f/ production in isolation and CV syllables, requiring slightly fewer cues.\n- Introduced a small set of initial /f/ words at the imitated level (e.g., \"fish,\" \"feet,\" \"fan\"). Accuracy was emerging, with some clear /f/ productions and some continued /p/ substitutions.\n\n4. Overall intelligibility\n- In spontaneous play, the child’s intelligibility appeared slightly improved, particularly when they slowed down and used practiced /s/ words. The child responded well to gentle reminders to \"use your special sound.\"\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build independence with initial /s/ in phrases and structured play, and begin monitoring for carryover into more spontaneous conversation.\n- Expand initial /f/ word practice as tolerated while continuing to support accuracy in isolation and syllables.\n- Home practice: caregiver to alternate days focusing on /s/ and /f/ words, using short, fun activities (e.g., hide-and-seek with picture cards)."

Reported that child often leaves off ending sounds and that “s” and “f” are hard to understand. No recent changes in health or hearing.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned with mild hesitation but separated from caregiver with support. Once in the room, engaged well with play-based tasks. Attention span was brief and required frequent redirection, but child was generally cheerful and willing to attempt imitation when given clear models.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1) Establish production of early developing consonants in isolation and simple syllables (focus on /p, b, m, t, d/)\n- Practiced CV and VC shapes (e.g., “pa,” “bee,” “me,” “up,” “eat”) in play with cars and animals.\n- Child could imitate /p, b, m/ in CV syllables with moderate verbal and visual cueing; accuracy was inconsistent and often reduced to open vowels.\n- Final consonants were usually omitted even with direct models (e.g., “up” → “uh,” “eat” → “ee”).\n\n2) Introduce awareness of final consonants in simple words\n- Used picture cards and a “quiet sound at the end” game (e.g., up, in, out, home).\n- Child occasionally produced a final consonant with heavy modeling and simultaneous production but was not yet able to do so independently.\n- Noted some awareness when SLP exaggerated final sound; child sometimes smiled and attempted to copy, but accuracy remained low.\n\n3) Initial /f/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Introduced /f/ using mirror, “bite lip, blow air” cue, and visual model.\n- Child could blow air but often did not maintain lip placement; productions frequently approximated /h/ or were silent airflow.\n- Very few clear /f/ productions despite maximal verbal, visual, and tactile cueing.\n\n4) Initial /s/ in isolation\n- Briefly probed /s/ with snake toy and mirror.\n- Child tended to substitute /t/ or /d/ for /s/ in attempts, with difficulty maintaining a long “hissy” sound.\n- Able to produce a short, inconsistent /s/-like sound when SLP provided hand cue and slowed rate, but this was not yet reliable.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build consistency for early consonants and increase awareness of final sounds.\n- Maintain focus on /f/ and /s/ at isolation and simple syllable level with high support.\n- Parent encouraged to model clear final sounds in everyday words (e.g., up, in, out) without asking child to repeat yet, just to increase exposure.\n- Next session: re-check /p, b, m, t, d/ in simple syllables; continue shaping /f/ and /s/ in isolation."

Participated well in structured turn-taking games. Some impulsivity and talking over the clinician, but generally cooperative. Took short breaks between tasks and returned with light prompting.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1) Early consonants in CV/VC syllables (/p, b, m, t, d/)\n- Repeated practice with picture cards and a pretend picnic activity.\n- Child imitated CV forms (e.g., “bee,” “tea,” “moo”) with increased consistency compared to last session; accuracy for initial consonants was generally good in imitation when focused.\n- VC forms (e.g., “up,” “eat,” “in”) remained more challenging, but child produced several clearer final consonants with simultaneous production.\n\n2) Final consonant awareness and production in simple words\n- Used a “put the sound on” game with minimal pairs (e.g., “bee/beep,” “tea/teeth” where appropriate for age).\n- Child produced a few accurate final consonants in imitation (e.g., “up,” “in”) with maximal verbal cueing and visual emphasis on the last sound.\n- Still frequently omitted final consonants in spontaneous attempts, but showed more frequent attempts to “add something at the end” when reminded.\n\n3) Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued mirror work with “bite lip, blow” cue, using a feather to visualize airflow.\n- Child produced several approximations that were closer to /f/ today; still often reverted to /h/ or labial closure, but there were more clear fricative sounds than last week.\n- Needed consistent modeling and reminders; no independent /f/ yet, but emerging awareness.\n\n4) Initial /s/ in isolation and simple CV syllables\n- Practiced /s/ with a toy snake and train, emphasizing “long, quiet snake sound.”\n- Child could hold a short /s/-like sound in imitation more often than last session, though productions were brief and sometimes stopped to /t/.\n- Able to imitate a few CV syllables (e.g., “see,” “soo”) with partial accuracy when watching SLP’s mouth.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue current targets as child is beginning to show emerging improvements, especially with early consonants and attempts at final sounds.\n- Parent encouraged to play simple “sound on/off” games at home (e.g., “up” vs. “uh”) with exaggerated models, no pressure for perfect copying.\n- Next session: continue building final consonants at VC level, and consolidate /f/ and /s/ in isolation before moving to more complex syllables."

Still generally cooperative and motivated by games.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1) Final consonants in CVC words and carrier phrases\n- Continued with familiar CVC list and carrier phrases, using a picture lotto game.\n- Child’s accuracy for final consonants at the single-word imitated level remained similar to prior sessions: generally good when focused and cued.\n- In phrases, performance was stable; final consonants were sometimes present and sometimes dropped as speech rate increased. No notable change in cueing level needed.\n\n2) Initial /f/ in CVC words and phrases\n- Practiced /f/ targets (fish, four, foot, fun) in “I see ___” and “my ___” phrases.\n- Child continued to show similar accuracy to last week, with recognizable /f/ in many imitated words.\n- Phrase-level productions were mixed, with some clear /f/ sounds and some approximations; still required verbal and visual cueing to maintain consistency.\n\n3) Initial /s/ in CVC words and simple phrases\n- Used snake-themed game to elicit /s/ words and short phrases.\n- Child produced /s/ fairly well in slow, imitated single words; substitutions persisted in faster or less-structured attempts.\n- Phrase-level performance was comparable to previous sessions; no clear increase or decrease in accuracy.\n\n4) Spontaneous speech monitoring\n- During free play, child used many short sentences and comments.\n- Intelligibility for familiar routines was fair, but omission of final consonants and inconsistent production of /f/ and /s/ still affected clarity for less familiar listeners.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Performance appears stable at the current level, suggesting a consolidation period. Continue with current word and phrase lists to reinforce skills.\n- Parent encouraged to maintain home practice with the same target words/phrases and to model slightly slower, clear speech without pressuring the child.\n- Next session: consider gradually introducing more naturalistic practice (e.g., structured play scenes) while keeping the same sound targets."

Initial /k/ in isolation and syllables\n- Established /k/ in isolation with simultaneous production and visual cueing (open mouth, “tongue back” gesture). Client achieved consistent productions in isolation with maximal verbal and visual support.\n- In simple CV syllables (\"kuh, kee, koh\"), accuracy was emerging; client often substituted /t/ but could correct with immediate models and jaw/tongue placement reminders.\n\n2. Final consonants (p, t, m) in CVC words – imitation\n- Targeted final /p, t, m/ in high-interest words (e.g., \"cup, up, cat, hat, mom, ham\") at the imitated word level.\n- Frequent omission of final consonants; many productions reduced to CV forms (\"cu\" for \"cup\").\n- With maximal verbal cues (\"say the sound at the end\") and tactile prompts on the table to “tap the last sound,” he produced some accurate final consonants, but consistency was low.\n\n3. Initial /f/ – awareness and isolation\n- Introduced /f/ using a mirror, focusing on “lip-bite and quiet air.”\n- Client could imitate a sustained /f/ with clinician modeling but tended to voice it or stop to /p/ when adding a vowel.\n- Needed continuous modeling and cueing; no independent /f/ productions observed in words yet.\n\n4. Functional phrase attempts\n- During play, client used several 2–3 word phrases (e.g., \"my car,\" \"more bubbles,\" \"I want that\") with reduced consonant accuracy.\n- SLP modeled clearer productions and encouraged imitation of short functional phrases; client imitated some with variable accuracy but good willingness.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue establishing /k/ in isolation and CV syllables before moving to word level.\n- Maintain focus on final /p, t, m/ in simple CVC words in imitation.\n- Continue building awareness of /f/ with mirror work and airflow cues.\n- Home practice: caregiver to model clear CVC words (\"cup, cat, mop\") in daily routines and encourage the child to “add the last sound,” praising any attempts rather than perfection."

Initial /k/ – CV and word level in imitation\n- Continued practice of /k/ in CV syllables and moved into simple words (\"key, car, cow, cat\").\n- Accuracy in CV syllables improved with moderate cueing; fewer /t/ substitutions compared to last session.\n- At word level, client produced initial /k/ correctly in several trials when given a model and “tongue back” cue, but consistency remained variable.\n\n2. Final consonants (p, t, m) – CVC imitation\n- Practiced final consonants using picture cards and a tapping cue for the last sound.\n- Client produced final /p/ and /m/ more frequently today (e.g., \"cup,\" \"mom\"), though often with reduced clarity.\n- Final /t/ remained more challenging with frequent omission or substitution; required maximal verbal prompts and slowed rate.\n\n3. Initial /f/ – isolation and CV syllables\n- Reviewed /f/ in the mirror; client imitated sustained /f/ with less direct hand-over-hand support.\n- In CV syllables (\"foo, fee\"), he produced several approximations with partial lip-bite and audible airflow, though voicing and stopping to /p/ still occurred.\n- Needed frequent reminders to “bite your lip and blow.”\n\n4. Functional phrases – imitation of 2–3 word combinations\n- In structured play, client imitated short phrases (\"my turn,\" \"more bubbles,\" \"big car\") in ~2-word length.\n- Consonant accuracy was inconsistent, but he showed more frequent attempts to copy the full phrase rather than only the final word.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue building consistency for initial /k/ at word level in imitation before advancing to phrases.\n- Maintain work on final /p, t, m/ with visual and tapping cues; consider minimal pairs (e.g., \"bee/beep\") in upcoming sessions.\n- Continue /f/ in isolation and CV syllables; do not advance to word level yet.\n- Home practice: caregiver to use a mirror for \"lip-bite\" /f/ practice and to highlight final sounds in familiar words (e.g., “cuP,” “caT”) using gentle reminders."

She notices he often leaves off sounds at the ends of words and that unfamiliar listeners frequently ask for repetition. No major changes since the initial evaluation.\n\nBehavior/engagement:\n- 4-year-old male. Transitioned to therapy room with brief hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance. Engaged well in play-based activities, especially with cars and animal figures. Attention was fair; needed intermittent redirection from self-directed play back to speech tasks. Accepted visual and verbal cues without distress.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Targeted final consonants in simple CVC words (e.g., \"cup, cap, cat, mat, map, mom\") at the imitated word level.\n- Frequently omitted final sounds or replaced them with a neutral vowel (e.g., \"cu-\" for \"cup\").\n- With simultaneous production and visual cueing (touching mouth, tapping picture), able to mark final consonant in some trials, but accuracy was inconsistent and required maximal cueing.\n\n2. Initial /k/ vs /t/ (fronting)\n- Focused on contrasting \"back sound\" /k/ with \"front sound\" /t/ in isolation and simple CV syllables (\"koo, key, kah\") using mirror and tactile cue at throat.\n- Tended to substitute /t/ for /k/ in spontaneous attempts (e.g., \"tar\" for \"car\").\n- In isolation, able to approximate /k/ in several trials with strong verbal modeling and slowed rate; productions remained inconsistent at the syllable level.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in single words\n- Introduced initial /s/ in isolation and in a few highly familiar words (\"sun, soup, sock\") using visual cue for \"long, quiet air.\"\n- Frequently produced /d/ or omitted the sound entirely in words.\n- Could hold a prolonged /s/ in isolation in a few attempts when watching clinician's mouth, but carryover to words was limited.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Observed in play: primarily using CV and CVCV (same vowel) syllable shapes (\"mama, dada, nana\"). Final consonant deletion noted frequently in spontaneous speech.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to target final consonants in simple CVC words at the imitated level with maximal cues.\n- Maintain focus on establishing /k/ in isolation and CV syllables before moving into more complex word forms.\n- Provide caregiver with simple home practice: 3–4 picture cards for CVC words emphasizing \"putting the sound on the end\" with slow, clear models. Encourage short, playful practice rather than drilling."

She continues to notice missing end sounds but feels he is \"trying harder\" to be understood. No new concerns.\n\nBehavior/engagement:\n- Entered room more readily today; greeted clinician with a quiet \"hi\". Participated well in turn-taking games and tolerated structured table-top tasks for brief periods. Required occasional breaks with preferred toys to maintain engagement. Accepted visual, verbal, and minimal tactile cues.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Practiced final /p, t, m/ in high-interest CVC words (\"cup, cap, cat, mat, map, mom, ham\") at the imitated word level.\n- Compared to last session, he more consistently attempted to add an ending sound rather than omitting it, though accuracy was still variable.\n- With visual cue (tapping picture at end of word) and slowed models, he produced perceptible final consonants in a greater proportion of trials. Still required frequent cueing but showed increased awareness and some self-correction attempts.\n\n2. Initial /k/ vs /t/\n- Continued work on /k/ in isolation and CV syllables using mirror and \"back sound\" cue.\n- Demonstrated more consistent ability to produce a clear /k/ in isolation when given multiple practice opportunities.\n- In CV syllables (\"key, car, cow\"), still often reverted to /t/, but there were several accurate imitated productions with maximal verbal cueing and slowed rate. Improvement from baseline but not yet stable.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in single words\n- Targeted initial /s/ in isolation and in a limited set of words (\"sun, soup, sock, seal\") at the imitated level.\n- Sustained /s/ in isolation more reliably than last session when watching clinician's mouth.\n- In words, productions remained inconsistent with frequent /d/ substitutions, but there were a few clearer approximations with combined gestural (finger to lip) and verbal cues.\n\n4. Syllable shapes / word structure\n- In spontaneous play, continued use of CV, CVCV, and some CVC words. Final consonant deletion still prominent, though he occasionally marked a final consonant in familiar words (\"up, out\") when excited.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on final consonants at the imitated CVC word level; reinforce any spontaneous attempts to add end sounds.\n- Maintain intensive practice for /k/ in isolation and CV syllables; not yet ready to systematically target at phrase level.\n- Provide caregiver with visual cue ideas (tapping at end of word) for home practice with 3–5 CVC words and a few initial /k/ words (\"car, key\") with slow models."

Occasional fronting to /t/ persisted, but overall accuracy and confidence improved. Appropriate to continue word-level practice.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple words\n- Practiced sustained /s/ in isolation, then in target words (\"sun, soup, sock, seal, soap\") at the imitated word level.\n- Isolation /s/ was produced more reliably, with longer duration and better control of airflow.\n- Word-level productions still variable; some approximations sounded closer to /s/, while others remained /d/ or omitted. Needed consistent modeling and gestural cues, but he attended well to the clinician's mouth and appeared to understand the difference.\n\n4. General intelligibility / syllable shapes\n- In play, used a mix of CV, CVCV, and some clearer CVC forms. Still evident final consonant deletion in spontaneous speech, but more attempts to add endings in highly familiar words.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue working on final consonants in CVC words; consider beginning to probe for carryover into short carrier phrases (\"my cup,\" \"big cat\") if accuracy remains stable.\n- Maintain practice of initial /k/ at the imitated word level; monitor readiness to introduce simple two-word combinations with /k/ (\"go car\").\n- Provide caregiver with a short list of CVC practice words and a few /k/ words, encouraging brief daily practice with positive feedback and modeling, not correction-heavy drills."

Initial /k/ in CVC words and emerging phrases\n- Targeted initial /k/ in words (\"car, key, coat, cow, cup\") at the imitated word level and then in simple two-word combinations (\"blue car, my key\").\n- Accuracy at word level was noticeably improved; fewer substitutions to /t/ and needed less intensive cueing.\n- In short phrases, he could maintain /k/ in the initial position in several attempts with verbal modeling and a reminder to use his \"back sound.\" Some reversion to /t/ when excited, but overall trend is positive.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words\n- Continued work on initial /s/ in isolation and words (\"sun, soup, sock, seal, soap, sand\") at the imitated level.\n- Isolation /s/ is now more consistent, with good airflow and minimal distortion when he is focused.\n- Word-level productions remain mixed: some clear /s/ productions were heard, but he still often substitutes /d/ or blends /s/ with the following vowel. Required frequent gestural cues and slowed rate.\n\n4. Intelligibility / syllable structure in play\n- In spontaneous play, used more recognizable CVC words, especially those practiced in therapy. Final consonant deletion continues for many words, but there is emerging awareness; he occasionally stopped and tried again when not understood.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue strengthening final consonant production in both single words and short carrier phrases to increase stability.\n- Maintain focus on initial /k/ in words and simple two-word combinations; not yet ready for more complex phrases.\n- Keep targeting initial /s/ at the imitated word level; consider introducing minimal pair contrasts (e.g., \"see/tea\") in future sessions.\n- Home practice: encourage parent to use short phrases with known CVC words (\"my cup,\" \"big map\") and model clear, slow speech, praising any attempts to add final sounds."

Participated well in structured turn-taking tasks, although attention waned near the end of the session, requiring short movement breaks. Continued to respond positively to specific praise for \"strong sounds.\"\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words and short phrases\n- Revisited final /p, t, m/ in CVC words and simple carrier phrases (\"my cup, big cat, mom's map\").\n- Performance was similar to the previous session. At the imitated word level, final consonants were usually present when provided with verbal reminders.\n- In short phrases, he continued to mark final consonants in many trials, but accuracy decreased when phrases became longer or when attention was reduced. No notable regression, but gains are still consolidating.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in words and short phrases\n- Practiced initial /k/ words (\"car, key, coat, cow, cup\") and two-word combinations (\"blue car, big key\").\n- Accuracy at the word level remained generally good with light cueing; some trials were produced independently.\n- In two-word phrases, he maintained /k/ in several attempts but continued to show occasional fronting when speaking quickly or when less focused.

Listener understanding improved for familiar contexts, though overall intelligibility remains reduced in more complex or less familiar language.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue strengthening final consonant production in carrier phrases and begin to increase phrase variety as accuracy allows.\n- Maintain initial /k/ work in two-word phrases; consider probing simple three-word phrases in upcoming sessions if consistency continues.\n- Continue initial /s/ at word level, with occasional supported phrases when he is successful.\n- Home practice: introduce short, repetitive phrases using picture cards (e.g., \"my cup,\" \"big cat\"), coaching parent to model and praise clear end sounds and back sounds. Provide handout with example phrases."

She feels his progress this week was similar to last week.\n\nBehavior/engagement:\n- Arrived cheerful and transitioned smoothly. Participated in table-top and floor activities with good cooperation. Required occasional prompts to slow down speech when excited. Continued to accept cues and feedback.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words and carrier phrases\n- Repeated practice of final /p, t, m, n/ in CVC words and short phrases (\"my cup, big cat, red pan, mom's moon\").\n- Accuracy at the imitated word level remained strong and similar to last session, with only light verbal cues needed.\n- In carrier phrases, performance was stable. He often produced final consonants correctly when focused, but still omitted them in longer or more rapid speech. No major changes from previous week.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in words and two-word phrases\n- Continued targeting initial /k/ in words and simple two-word phrases (\"my car, big cow, red cup\").\n- Accuracy was comparable to last session: many correct productions with occasional fronting to /t/ when distracted or speaking quickly.\n- A few spontaneous correct /k/ words were heard in play (e.g., \"car\" while driving toy cars), consistent with previous observations.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases\n- Worked on initial /s/ in isolation, words, and supported short phrases (\"sun up, big sock\").\n- Isolation /s/ continued to be strong; word-level accuracy showed similar variability as in prior session.\n- In phrases, he required maximal modeling and gestural cues and was not yet consistent.\n\n4. Intelligibility in play\n- During free play, he used several familiar CVC words with clearer endings, but many longer or less familiar words still lacked final consonants. Overall intelligibility remained moderately reduced but functional with contextual support.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Maintain current targets and levels to allow consolidation of skills before increasing complexity.\n- Continue home practice with short phrases using familiar words, emphasizing slow rate and clear endings.\n- Plan to probe slightly longer phrases and additional word sets in upcoming sessions if performance remains stable."

Child starting preschool in the fall.\n- Mom notices he often leaves off the ends of words and says “do” for “go,” “tat” for “cat.”\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with some initial hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance.\n- Once engaged in play, he was cheerful and interactive, though easily distracted by new toys and needed intermittent redirection to speech tasks.\n- Responded well to visual supports and turn-taking games.\n\nGoals / observations:\n1. Establish baseline for speech sound production\n- Informal play-based speech sample revealed frequent final consonant deletion (e.g., “ca” for “cat,” “bee” for “beep”), and some initial sound substitutions (/t/ for /k/, /d/ for /g/; occasional /p/ for /f/).\n- Syllable shapes observed included CV, CVCV (same and alternating), and some CVC words, often missing final consonants.\n- Intelligibility judged to be fair in context with familiar listener (SLP) but reduced for out-of-context phrases.\n\n2. Initial /k/ and /g/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Child was able to imitate /k/ in isolation inconsistently with visual cue to “tap tongue at the back” and model; often reverted to /t/.\n- /g/ in isolation was more difficult; most attempts approximated /d/.\n- In CV syllables (e.g., “koo,” “kah”), child needed maximal verbal and visual cueing and simultaneous production; only a few clear productions noted.\n\n3. Final consonant production (awareness and imitation)\n- Introduced concept of “sound at the end” using minimal pairs and picture cards (e.g., “bee/beep,” “bow/boat”).\n- With direct imitation and emphasis on the final consonant, child could sometimes add final /p/ or /t/ but consistency was low; required frequent modeling and slowed rate.\n- Tended to add a neutral vowel after final consonants (e.g., “cat-uh”).\n\n4. Early /f/ in initial position (emerging awareness)\n- Briefly probed initial /f/ in single words (fish, fun, five) using “bite lip and blow” visual cue.\n- Child often substituted /p/ or omitted the fricative component; one or two close approximations with hand cue for airflow.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to build rapport and play-based participation while targeting initial /k, g/ in isolation and CV syllables, and final consonant production for /p, t/.\n- Encourage parent to model slow, clear speech at home and highlight final sounds in daily routines (e.g., “up,” “bed,” “cup”).\n- Provide parent with simple picture cards to practice 5 short CVC words with final /p/ once per day, focusing on listening and imitation rather than perfection."

Initial /g/ in isolation\n- /g/ remained more challenging; continued to substitute /d/ frequently.\n- A few approximations were heard when pairing sound with gross motor movement (e.g., jumping for “go”), but accuracy remained low and required maximal support.\n\n3. Final /p/ and /t/ in CVC words (imitation)\n- Practiced high-interest words (e.g., “cup,” “up,” “hot,” “hat”) using picture cards and toy reinforcers.\n- With direct imitation and slowed rate, child produced some clear final /p/ and /t/, but often omitted final consonant when excited or speaking quickly.\n- When cued to “tap the last sound,” he attempted to add a final consonant, even if not always accurate.\n\n4. Syllable shape expansion (CVCV)\n- Practiced simple CVCV words (e.g., “bunny,” “happy,” “cookie”) in play.\n- Most syllables were present, though some consonants were distorted or simplified.\n- Child enjoyed chanting and singing-style repetition, which supported increased participation.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on initial /k/ in isolation and simple CV syllables; maintain /g/ at isolation level only for now.\n- Keep practicing a small set of CVC words with final /p, t/ at home, emphasizing listening for the “last sound.”\n- Introduce a visual cue (e.g., tapping a picture edge) to mark the final sound for home practice."

Initial /k/ at word and short phrase level\n- Performance at the imitated word level for initial /k/ remained similar to last week, with good consistency.\n- In short, imitated carrier phrases (e.g., “my car,” “blue cookie”), accuracy was generally stable; he maintained /k/ in many attempts but still had occasional /t/ substitutions.\n- Spontaneous /k/ productions in play were observed but were not yet consistent across all opportunities.\n\n2. Initial /g/ at isolation and early word level\n- /g/ in isolation remained variable but slightly more consistent when child was focused.\n- At the word level (go, game, gum), he could imitate a few recognizable /g/ productions with moderate cueing; however, he often reverted to /d/ without cues.\n- Not yet ready to expand to phrases for /g/.\n\n3. Final /p/ and /t/ in CVC words\n- Continued to practice final consonants in familiar words within play.\n- Imitated productions with final /p/ and /t/ were generally similar in accuracy to last session, with some clear examples and some omissions.\n- In more spontaneous contexts, endings were often dropped, though he occasionally attempted to add the final sound after a reminder.\n\n4. Initial /f/ at word and short phrase level\n- Child maintained similar performance on initial /f/ words compared to previous session.\n- In imitated phrases (e.g., “fun fish,” “my foot”), accuracy was mixed; he often produced a recognizable /f/ but sometimes used /p/ or a weak fricative.\n- Continued to benefit from visual modeling and reminders to “bite lip and blow.”\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue at current levels for /k/, /g/, /f/, and final consonants, focusing on stabilizing performance and building consistency.\n- Encourage caregiver to keep home practice brief and frequent, using favorite toys and routines.\n- Consider introducing simple visual charts or stickers to increase motivation for practicing target words at home."

Initial /k/ at word and short phrase level\n- At the imitated word level, /k/ productions remained generally strong and similar to last session.\n- In short phrases (e.g., “my car,” “big cookie”), accuracy was comparable to previous week, with many correct /k/ sounds but occasional substitutions.\n- Fewer spontaneous /k/ productions were observed today, likely related to reduced attention to speech tasks.\n\n2. Initial /g/ at isolation and word level\n- /g/ in isolation showed similar performance to last session; accurate productions were achievable with focused cueing.\n- At the word level (go, game), he produced some recognizable /g/ sounds but remained inconsistent, often reverting to /d/ when less supported.\n\n3. Final /p/ and /t/ in CVC words\n- Practiced final consonants in familiar words within play-based tasks.\n- Imitated productions were similar to prior sessions: some clear final consonants, some omissions.\n- In more spontaneous speech, endings were frequently dropped; occasional self-correction was noted when the SLP highlighted the final sound.\n\n4. Initial /f/ in words and short phrases\n- Performance on initial /f/ remained stable. He produced recognizable /f/ in several imitated words with visual support.\n- In short phrases, accuracy was mixed, with some correct /f/ and some /p/ substitutions.\n- Continued to respond to mirror work and airflow cues.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Maintain current targets to allow for consolidation, with emphasis on keeping child engaged through varied, motivating activities.\n- Encourage caregiver to continue brief practice of /k/ and final consonants in daily routines (e.g., “cup,” “hat,” “car”).\n- Plan to introduce slightly more structured phrase-level practice for /k/ when attention allows."

Initial /s/ at the imitated syllable and word level\n- Targets: \"see, sew, soo,\" and simple words (sun, soup, sock, sand).\n- At the imitated syllable level, child produced /s/ correctly in approximately half of attempts; errors often included /d/ substitutions or omission of the sound.\n- At the word level, child required frequent modeling and visual cueing (watching clinician’s mouth). Accuracy was low and productions were inconsistent.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Introduced /f/ in isolation using \"quiet lip\" and airflow cues.\n- Child could briefly sustain the /f/ sound in isolation with direct modeling and tactile cueing on the lips, though productions were short and sometimes voiced.\n- When adding a vowel (\"fee, foo, faa\"), child tended to stop the sound (e.g., \"pee\" for \"fee\").\n\n3. Early /s/-blends in imitation (exploratory)\n- Briefly probed /s/-blends (\"sp, st\") in isolation and within a few simple words (spin, spot, stop) to establish baseline.\n- Child primarily omitted the /s/ or produced a cluster reduction (e.g., \"pin\" for \"spin\").\n- Able to notice when clinician produced the “long sound” at the start but not yet able to consistently add it to their own productions.\n\n4. Functional phrase length (spontaneous speech)\n- In play, child used mostly 2–3 word phrases (e.g., \"my car go,\" \"I want that,\" \"more bubbles\").\n- Some 4-word phrases were heard with reduced clarity, often with consonant omissions.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to build awareness of /s/ and /f/ at isolation and simple syllable levels with strong visual and tactile cueing.\n- Introduce a small set of functional /s/ words for consistent practice.\n- Home practice: caregiver to model and play with “snake sound” (/s/) and “quiet lip” (/f/) in a brief, play-based format (1–2 minutes) without pressure for perfect accuracy.\n- Next session: repeat probes for initial /s/, /f/, and simple blends to confirm baseline and begin tracking change."

Initial /s/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- Reviewed isolation and CV syllables (\"see, soo, saa\"). Child produced /s/ more consistently with visual model and reminder to “keep tongue behind teeth,” achieving moderate accuracy at the syllable level.\n- At the word level (sun, soup, sock, sand, seat), accuracy improved relative to baseline but remained inconsistent.

Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced /f/ in isolation with mirror and airflow cues. Child was able to sustain /f/ briefly in more than half of opportunities when reminded to “bite lip, blow air.”\n- In CV syllables (\"fee, foo, fa\"), there were fewer stops to /p/ than previous session but still present. Child responded to a slower rate and segmented practice (holding /f/ before adding vowel).\n\n3. /s/-blends at imitated word level (continued baseline)\n- Re-introduced /s/-blends in simple words (spin, spot, stop, spoon, star).\n- Child still frequently omitted /s/ (“pin,” “top”), but showed a few emerging attempts to lengthen the onset when cued to “add the snake sound first.”\n- Minimal pairs (spin/pin, stop/top) were introduced; child correctly pointed to clinician’s word more often than last week, suggesting growing awareness even though production remains limited.\n\n4. Spontaneous phrase length and intelligibility\n- Child produced a mix of 2–4 word phrases during play (\"I want more bubbles,\" \"my turn now,\" \"that my car\").\n- Overall intelligibility with the clinician was reduced but slightly better when topic was known and context supported guesses.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue intensive practice with initial /s/ and /f/ at syllable and simple word levels; maintain focus on clear placement cues.\n- Begin to incorporate a small set of familiar /s/-blend words into play, emphasizing listening and awareness rather than accuracy.\n- Home practice: caregiver to use mirror play for /f/ and to model slow, clear /s/ at the start of familiar words (sun, soup) without asking for constant repetition.\n- Next session: monitor whether improved awareness of /s/ is maintained; consider expanding to short carrier phrases for the strongest /s/ words if accuracy continues to rise."

Initial /s/ at carrier phrase and short sentence level\n- Practiced phrases and simple sentences such as \"I see sun,\" \"I see soap,\" \"my sock is wet,\" and \"I see soup.\"\n- In imitation, accuracy was high with only occasional reminders to keep the tongue behind the teeth.\n- Child produced some of these phrases and short sentences independently during picture description and play, with generally clear /s/ productions.\n\n2. Initial /f/ at word and phrase level\n- Targets: fish, fun, feet, food, four, fan, fire.\n- At word level, /f/ was produced accurately in most attempts without the need for a mirror; occasional cues were provided to maintain airflow.\n- In short phrases (\"my feet,\" \"four cars,\" \"more fish\"), child maintained /f/ with moderate consistency, showing fewer stops to /p/ compared with earlier sessions.\n\n3. /s/-blends at imitated word and emerging phrase level\n- Words: spin, spot, stop, star, spoon, slide.\n- Child showed increased accuracy for /st/ and /sp/ blends in imitation, especially with segmented production followed by whole-word practice.\n- Trialed simple phrases (\"stop it,\" \"spin it,\" \"big star\"); child could sometimes maintain the blend in phrases when given a clear model first, though accuracy decreased when speaking quickly.\n\n4. Spontaneous speech and intelligibility\n- Child used many 3–5 word utterances spontaneously during play (\"I want to drive the car,\" \"that one go in there now\").\n- Intelligibility to the clinician was noticeably better, especially when context was known and when using practiced /s/ and /f/ words.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue expanding sentence-level practice for initial /s/ with a focus on functional, play-based sentences.\n- Maintain /f/ at phrase level and gradually increase complexity (e.g., adding adjectives or prepositional phrases).\n- Continue to refine /s/-blends, alternating between segmented and whole-word practice and slowly increasing phrase use.\n- Home practice: provide parent with a short list of target words and phrases for /s/ and /f/ to use during routines (getting dressed, snack time). Emphasize praise for effort and clear productions.\n- Next session: monitor consistency of sentence-level /s/ and consider adding new /s/ words if current set is stable."

Caregiver noted child will sometimes repeat words if asked but gets \"silly\" when corrected.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child transitioned into the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance.\n- Once settled, engaged well in play-based activities and responded to visual games and toys.\n- Attention to adult-directed tasks was brief (2–3 minutes) and required frequent redirection from self-directed play.\n\nGoals / Treatment Focus:\n1. Establish awareness of final consonants (CVC words)\n   - Used picture cards and simple toys to elicit CVC words (e.g., \"cup,\" \"bus,\" \"bed\").\n   - Child frequently omitted final consonants in spontaneous attempts (e.g., \"bu\" for \"bus\").\n   - With direct imitation and visual cueing (touching mouth, pointing to final sound icon), child produced the final consonant in some trials, but productions were inconsistent and often reduced to a vowel-consonant blend.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at syllable and simple word level (imitation)\n   - Practiced /k/ in isolation using \"back sound\" cues (e.g., \"tongue goes in the back\").\n   - Child was able to approximate /k/ in isolation in about half of attempts, with frequent substitution of /t/.\n   - At syllable level (\"koo,\" \"kah\") and in simple words (\"car,\" \"key\"), productions were mostly /t/; occasional correct productions with simultaneous model and verbal cueing.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n   - Introduced /s/ as a \"long, quiet snake sound\" with visual model and mirror.\n   - Child could prolong a \"hissy\" sound in isolation with heavy support, but there was frequent stopping or distortion.\n   - Attempts in CV syllables (\"see,\" \"soo\") were mostly reduced to /t/ or /d/; occasional closer approximations when watching clinician's mouth.\n\n4. Baseline observation of overall speech sound patterns\n   - In play-based conversation, child showed frequent final consonant deletion, fronting of /k/ and /g/ to /t/ and /d/, and variable vowel clarity.\n   - Syllable shapes heard: V, CV, CVCV; CVC was emerging but inconsistent.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to build awareness of final consonants and back sounds (/k/) at the imitation level.\n- Use simple CVC words in play at home; caregiver to model and gently emphasize final sound (e.g., \"cuP,\" \"buS\") without pressuring child to repeat.\n- Next session: re-check /k/ and final consonants; consider introducing visual markers (tokens/picture cues) for beginning vs. ending sounds."

Initial /k/ at syllable and word level\n   - Revisited /k/ in isolation using mirror and tongue placement cues.\n   - Child demonstrated similar performance to last session: frequent fronting to /t/ and needed maximal verbal and visual cues for back placement.\n   - In words (\"car,\" \"key,\" \"cow\"), correct /k/ was rare and mostly occurred with simultaneous production and slowed rate.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n   - Used \"snake sound\" visuals and mirror work.\n   - Child could briefly produce a noisy airflow sound but often stopped it quickly or replaced it with /t/.\n   - Accuracy in CV syllables remained low; child was somewhat more willing to attempt multiple trials but still required intensive modeling.\n\n4. Early awareness of \"slow vs. fast\" talking for clarity\n   - Introduced idea of \"slow speech\" when playing with cars (fast vs. slow) to help with clarity.\n   - Child could imitate short words with slightly slower rate when cued, though sound accuracy did not yet change significantly.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Skills remain at early acquisition level; continue focusing on awareness and imitation rather than independence.\n- Encourage caregiver to model clear CVC words at home during daily routines (e.g., \"cup,\" \"bed,\" \"soap\") without asking for frequent repetitions.\n- Next session: trial additional visual supports (e.g., picture cues for \"front\" vs. \"back\" sounds) and consider adding simple /k/ in final position if tolerated."

She notices more clarity when the child is talking slowly or repeating after her. No major changes since recent assessment; child starting junior kindergarten in the fall.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nChild transitioned to the therapy room with brief hesitation, then engaged well in play-based activities. Needed some redirection away from preferred toys but responded to visual schedules and clear expectations. Participated in imitation tasks with good effort and responded well to specific praise.\n\nGoals/activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, m, t/)\n- Targeted simple CVC words (e.g., \"map, mop, mat, up, cup, mom\") at the imitated word level.\n- Child frequently omitted final consonants in spontaneous speech (e.g., \"ma\" for \"map\"), but with direct imitation and visual cueing (tapping for the last sound), produced clearer final consonants in some trials.\n- Accuracy was inconsistent; often added a vowel after the final sound (\"map-uh\"). Continued to require models and reminders to \"stop the sound at the end.\"\n\n2. Initial /k/ vs /t/\n- Practiced initial /k/ in simple words (\"key, car, cow\") using a \"back sound\" cue and mirror work.\n- Child tended to substitute /t/ for /k/ (e.g., \"tea\" for \"key\") on first attempts.\n- With maximal verbal and visual cueing (hand to throat, \"tongue up and back\"), was able to imitate /k/ in isolation in several attempts; carryover to words remained limited.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in single words\n- Introduced initial /s/ in isolation and then in a few single words (\"sun, soup, sock\").\n- Child was able to approximate /s/ in isolation when given a \"snake sound\" cue and encouraged to keep the tongue behind the teeth.\n- In words, productions were variable, with some substitutions (e.g., \"dun\" for \"sun\"). Required frequent models and visual cues.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\nContinue to focus on final consonant production in simple CVC words and establishing consistent /k/ and /s/ at the imitated word level. Parent was shown how to emphasize last sounds in everyday words (e.g., \"up, in, out\") and encouraged to model slow, clear speech without pressuring the child to repeat. Will reassess readiness to increase complexity once accuracy improves."

Initial /k/ in words\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation and in initial position of simple words (\"key, car, cow, cake\").\n- Child produced /k/ in isolation more consistently with a \"cough\"/\"back sound\" cue.\n- At the word level, substitutions to /t/ still occurred, but there were several clear productions of \"key\" and \"car\" after a direct model. Needed moderate to maximal cueing but demonstrated more attempts and fewer refusals.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words and simple phrases\n- Targeted initial /s/ in words (\"sun, soup, sock, seat\") using a \"quiet snake\" visual and mirror.\n- Child was able to produce /s/ in isolation in most attempts with verbal reminders to \"keep teeth together.\"\n- At the word level, accuracy improved slightly compared to last session, with more consistent approximations. Still required frequent modeling; occasional substitution to /d/ or omission of the sound.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\nContinue current focus on final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/ at the imitated word level. Accuracy is beginning to emerge but is not yet consistent. Parent encouraged to play short listening games at home (\"Do you hear the end in 'up'?\") and to keep practice brief and fun. Will consider introducing simple carrier phrases once word-level productions become more reliable."

Attention to table-top tasks improved; tolerated slightly longer practice sets when activities were embedded in games. Showed some self-monitoring, laughing when hearing \"silly\" productions.\n\nGoals/activities:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words (/p, m, t, k/)\n- Practiced a larger set of CVC words (\"map, mop, mat, cup, cut, back, book, mom\") at the imitated word level and in short carrier phrases (\"my ___\").\n- Child demonstrated noticeably better consistency with final /p/ and /m\" in imitation, often producing the ending without an additional vowel.\n- Final /t/ and /k/ remained more challenging, but there were several accurate attempts when given a visual cue (pointing to the final sound icon) and slowed rate.\n- Able to maintain some final consonants within simple phrases (e.g., \"my cup\") with moderate cues.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in words and CV syllables\n- Continued work on initial /k/ using CV syllables (\"ku, ki, ko\") and simple words.\n- Child produced /k/ in isolation with good success after initial cueing, needing fewer repetitions.\n- In words, substitutions to /t/ decreased slightly; there were multiple clear productions of \"key\" and \"cow\" in imitation. Still needed verbal reminders about \"back sound,\" but less physical prompting.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words and emerging phrases\n- Targeted /s/ in initial position of familiar words (\"sun, soup, sock, sand, seat\") during a picture lotto game.\n- Child produced /s/ in isolation consistently when given a brief model.\n- At the word level, accuracy improved, with more consistent initial /s/ and fewer substitutions. Some attempts at two-word phrases (\"see sun,\" \"see sock\") were made in imitation, with partial carryover of /s/.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\nGiven the child’s increasing consistency with final consonants and initial /s/ and /k/ in imitation, we will continue to strengthen accuracy at the word level and gradually expand to more carrier phrases where appropriate. Parent was encouraged to model short two-word phrases highlighting final sounds (e.g., \"big cup\") and to praise any clear final consonants, even if the rest of the word is approximate."

Family is motivated to work on clear speech.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- 4-year-old child transitioned to the therapy room with brief hesitation but separated from caregiver with encouragement. Once in the room, engaged well with toys and accepted structured tasks. Attention was variable; needed intermittent redirection back to speech activities but responded to visual supports and play-based routines.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Establish production of /k/ and /g/ in isolation\n- Targeted back sounds /k/ and /g/ in isolation using mirrors, visuals, and play with cars and animals. Child frequently substituted /t/ and /d/ for /k/ and /g/ (e.g., saying \"t\" for /k/). With simultaneous productions and maximal verbal/visual cueing (\"tongue back, coughing sound\"), child produced approximations of /k/ in ~3–4 attempts per 10 trials. /g/ was more difficult; mostly produced /d/ despite repeated modeling. Able to briefly feel the \"back of the tongue\" with clinician hand-over-hand to touch throat area, but carryover to sound production was inconsistent.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Introduced \"long, quiet snake sound\" /s/ in isolation. Child could imitate a prolonged /s/ in 4/10 attempts with strong visual cueing and clinician modeling. Productions were often too short or voiced (more like /z/). Trialed CV syllables (\"see,\" \"soo\") in a few attempts; most responses were approximations with variable accuracy. Required direct imitation and maximal cues; no independent productions observed.\n\n3. Final consonant awareness (CVC words)\n- In play with picture cards (e.g., \"bus,\" \"cup,\" \"cat\"), child frequently omitted final consonants or reduced them to a weak vowel (\"bu,\" \"cu\"). Clinician modeled clear final sounds and used tapping and segmenting. Child was able to imitate clearer final consonants in 2–3 opportunities per word with heavy support. No spontaneous final consonant productions in connected play.\n\n4. Functional communication / phrase length observation\n- During free play, child primarily used single words and short memorized phrases (\"my turn,\" \"I want\"). Intelligibility in connected speech was reduced due to sound errors and omissions. Child attempted to repair breakdowns when not understood by repeating or pointing.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build consistency for /k/ and /g/ in isolation before moving to syllables. Maintain focus on establishing a stable /s/ in isolation and simple CV syllables. Continue modeling final consonants in simple CVC words.\n- Home program: caregiver to practice \"coughing sound\" /k/ in front of the mirror using fun car/animal pictures, aiming for a few short, positive practice bursts per day. Encourage slow, clear models at home without pressuring the child."

She feels speech is still mostly unclear but has noticed more attempts.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated from caregiver with minimal hesitation today and eagerly joined play. Demonstrated good participation in structured games when activities were short and varied. Some impulsive talking over clinician, but easily redirected using visual cues and turn-taking routines.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Reviewed /k/ in isolation. Compared to last session, child produced a clearer /k/ with clinician model in approximately half of the opportunities. Able to maintain tongue-back posture with verbal cue \"back sound\" and visual mirror support. Transitioned into simple CV syllables (\"koo,\" \"kah,\" \"kee\") during a car-racing game. In imitation, produced approximations in most trials, with several clearly recognizable /k/ syllables. Still needed frequent cues, but accuracy and confidence were notably improved from baseline.\n\n2. /g/ in isolation\n- Reintroduced /g/ using \"frog sound\" imagery. Child continued to prefer /d/, but there were a few clearer /g/ approximations during simultaneous productions. Some emerging awareness of the difference when clinician contrasted \"do\" vs. \"go\" with visual mouth cues. Accuracy remains low overall, but child is beginning to attempt /g/ more consistently.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced \"snake sound\" /s/ in isolation, then in \"see/soo/suh\" during a feeding-toys game. Compared to last session, child could hold a longer, quieter /s/ in more trials with visual support (finger to lips, snake picture). In imitation, produced /s/ in isolation correctly in approximately 6/10 attempts; CV syllables were less consistent but present in several recognizable productions. Still requires direct modeling and cueing but showing emerging control.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)\n- Continued to model final consonants in CVC words (\"bus,\" \"bed,\" \"cup,\" \"dog\"). With imitation and segmenting/tapping cues, child produced clearer final sounds in more attempts than previous session, particularly for /p/ and /t/. Still frequently omitted final consonants in spontaneous play, but in structured drill, accuracy in imitation is beginning to increase.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on /k/ CV syllables and begin to stabilize these before moving to word-level. Continue to elicit /s/ in isolation and CV syllables with visual supports. Ongoing emphasis on awareness of final consonants in CVC words.\n- Home practice: encourage short practice of \"back sound\" /k/ in fun syllables (\"koo,\" \"kah\") and \"snake sound\" /s/ in front of a mirror. Caregiver to emphasize listening and praise for attempts rather than perfection."

She reports no major changes in overall intelligibility yet but feels the child is \"trying hard.\"\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered the room independently and quickly engaged with a farm and car play set. Participated well in turn-taking games, with short breaks for movement as needed. Demonstrated good imitation of clinician's play actions and was generally cheerful and cooperative.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. /k/ initial at syllable and simple word level (imitation)\n- Built on previous work by practicing /k/ in CV syllables and then in high-interest words (\"car,\" \"cow,\" \"key,\" \"cup\"). In imitation, child produced accurate or close approximations of /k/ in initial position in the majority of trials. Needed verbal reminder \"back sound\" and occasional visual cue in the mirror, but less physical prompting. Several productions of \"car\" and \"cow\" were clear enough to be understood without context. This represents a step forward from the previous session.\n\n2. /g/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued targeting /g/ with \"frog\" and \"go\" games. Child showed slightly increased willingness to attempt /g/, with a few recognizable productions in CV syllables (\"goo,\" \"gah\"). Still frequently substituted /d/ and required maximal modeling and contrast pairs (\"do\" vs. \"go\"). Progress is gradual but there is more consistent effort.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Revisited /s/ using snake visuals. Child produced a sustained /s/ in imitation in more than half of opportunities. CV syllables (\"see,\" \"soo\") were attempted throughout the session, with variable clarity. Some productions drifted toward /sh/ or /z/, but overall control of airflow is improving. Still at an imitated syllable level with heavy support.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)\n- Practiced CVC words (\"bus,\" \"boat,\" \"cup,\" \"dog\") using picture cards and a fishing game. Child imitated final consonants when the clinician segmented the word and tapped the final sound. Accuracy remains inconsistent; some trials had clear final /p/ and /t/, others omitted. Child is beginning to notice when the clinician emphasizes \"end sounds\" and occasionally attempted to self-correct after a model.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating /k/ initial at the word level in imitation, especially functional words (car, key, cup). Maintain practice with /s/ in syllables and begin introducing a small set of /s/ initial words in imitation if accuracy remains steady. Ongoing support for final consonants.\n- Home practice: encourage use of \"car,\" \"cow,\" and \"key\" during daily routines. Caregiver to model slowly and praise any attempt with a back sound /k/, even if not perfect."

She notes that other words are still hard to understand, especially in fast speech.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned smoothly and was eager to show the clinician toy cars. Maintained attention for longer structured tasks today, especially when activities were game-based. Followed simple directions and responded well to visual schedules and turn-taking cues.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. /k/ initial at word and emerging phrase level (imitation and cued)\n- Practiced a set of initial /k/ words (\"car,\" \"cow,\" \"cookie,\" \"cup,\" \"cat\") in a picture lotto game. In imitation, child produced a clear /k/ at the beginning of these words in most attempts with only light verbal reminders (\"back sound\"). Accuracy at the word level was notably improved from last session. Began to trial short two-word phrases (\"my car,\" \"big cat\") with initial /k/ words. At this level, child could often maintain /k/ in 2–3 of 5 attempts, with some reversion to /t/ when speaking faster. Overall, reduced cueing was needed compared to prior sessions.\n\n2. /g/ in isolation and simple words (imitation)\n- Continued to work on /g/ using \"go,\" \"gum,\" and \"gate\" in a car-race and pretend store activity. There was a modest increase in recognizable /g/ productions, particularly in \"go\" during a repeated chant. Child still needed maximal modeling and contrast pairs and is not yet consistently differentiating /g/ from /d/, but more frequent attempts and a few clearer productions were observed.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and word level (imitation)\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation and then in a small set of initial /s/ words (\"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"soap\") during a pretend bath-time game. In isolation, child produced a fairly steady /s/ in most trials. At the imitated word level, accuracy was emerging: some productions had a clear /s/, while others shifted to /sh/ or /d/. With visual cue (smile, teeth together, \"snake sound\"), child was able to correct a few attempts after clinician feedback, indicating growing awareness.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)\n- Targeted final /p/ and /t/ in words like \"cup,\" \"up,\" \"hat,\" \"boat.\" With segmenting, tapping, and slow modeling, child achieved clearer final consonant productions in several trials. Accuracy is still inconsistent, but compared to earlier sessions, there are more instances where the final sound is audible and intentional, especially in structured drill. Spontaneous speech continues to show frequent final consonant omission.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen /k/ in initial position at the word and short phrase level, aiming for more consistent use in two-word combinations. Maintain /s/ work at the imitated word level. Ongoing practice for /g/ and final consonants.\n- Home program: caregiver to use simple two-word phrases with /k/ words (\"my car,\" \"blue cup\") and encourage the child to copy. Remind family to give specific praise for \"back sound\" productions."

Demonstrated good participation in both structured and play-based tasks. Needed occasional movement breaks but returned to tasks with minimal prompting.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. /k/ initial at word and short phrase level (imitation and cued)\n- Continued targeting initial /k/ words (\"car,\" \"cup,\" \"cookie,\" \"key,\" \"cat\") in a board game and picture matching activity. Child maintained a relatively high level of accuracy at the imitated word level with light verbal prompts. In short two-word phrases (\"my car,\" \"go car,\" \"big cat\"), /k/ was produced clearly in many attempts, though some substitutions to /t/ still occurred when the child was excited or speaking quickly. Overall performance is similar to last week, with some consolidation of skills.\n\n2. /g/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Revisited /g/ with frog and \"go\" races. Child attempted /g/ more consistently but still showed frequent /d/ substitutions. A few clearer /g/ productions emerged in CV syllables (\"goo,\" \"gah\"), especially when the clinician slowed the rate and used strong visual and tactile cues. Accuracy is gradually improving, but still remains less stable than /k/.\n\n3. Initial /s/ at imitated word level\n- Practiced initial /s/ words (\"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"soap,\" \"sand\") in a sensory bin activity. Child's ability to produce /s/ at the start of these words was similar to last session: some clear productions, some substitutions to /sh/ or omission. With cues to \"smile\" and \"long, quiet sound,\" child could correct a few attempts, but overall consistency has not yet shifted significantly.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)\n- Continued work on final /p/ and /t/ (\"cup,\" \"up,\" \"hat,\" \"boat\") and introduced a few final /k/ words (\"back,\" \"book\"). With modeling and tapping, child produced clearer final consonants in several imitated trials, though there was still frequent omission when attention waned.

She notices that the child is beginning to \"listen\" to their own speech more. No new concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered the room independently and was very engaged with a new board game. Attention to task was improved, with longer periods of focus. Responded well to verbal praise and was motivated by earning small stickers.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. /k/ initial at word and short phrase level; emerging spontaneous use\n- Targeted initial /k/ words in structured games and play (\"car,\" \"cup,\" \"cookie,\" \"cat,\" \"cow\"). At the imitated word level, child demonstrated high accuracy with minimal cueing. In short phrases (\"my car,\" \"blue cup,\" \"big cat\"), child produced /k/ accurately in most attempts and began to self-correct when errors occurred. During free play, a few spontaneous productions of \"car\" and \"cup\" with clear /k/ were noted without direct prompting. This reflects a meaningful step toward generalization beyond pure imitation.\n\n2. /g/ in CV syllables and initial word level (imitation)\n- Practiced /g/ with \"go,\" \"gum,\" and \"game\" during a race and pretend store. Child produced recognizable /g/ in CV syllables more frequently than in prior sessions, especially for \"go\" in a repeated chant. At the imitated word level, there were several accurate productions, though consistency remains variable. Less physical prompting was needed; verbal and visual cues were usually sufficient.\n\n3. Initial /s/ at imitated word level and emerging phrases\n- Continued with initial /s/ words (\"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"soap,\" \"sit\") in a morning-routine pretend play. Child produced a clearer /s/ in more trials today, especially when cued to \"smile\" and \"keep tongue behind teeth.\" In a few two-word combinations (\"sun up,\" \"sock on\"), child was able to maintain /s/ with moderate cues. Some substitutions to /sh/ and omissions persisted but overall accuracy and awareness showed a moderate improvement.\n\n4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)\n- Focused on final /p/, /t/, and /k/ in CVC words (\"cup,\" \"hat,\" \"back,\" \"book\"). With slowed rate and explicit segmentation, child produced final consonants more consistently than previous weeks. There were more trials with audible and intentional final sounds, although spontaneous speech still often lacked them. Child occasionally attempted to add a final sound after a clinician reminder, indicating growing awareness.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Begin to expand /k/ into more varied words and short phrases and monitor for spontaneous use in play. Continue to strengthen /g/ at the imitated word level and support /s/ in both word and simple phrase contexts. Maintain final consonant practice with high-frequency CVC words.\n- Home program: encourage child to use /k/ words in simple sentences (\"I see car,\" \"my cup please\") during daily routines. Caregiver to model and gently prompt self-correction if child seems willing (\"Listen, I heard tar, can you try car?\")."

Initial /s/ at word and simple phrase level (imitation)\n- Practiced /s/ words (\"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"soap,\" \"sand,\" \"sit,\" \"see\") during a park pretend play. Child produced /s/ correctly in a portion of imitated word-level trials; accuracy decreased somewhat in phrases (\"see sun,\" \"sit on seat\") without strong cues. Visual and verbal prompts (\"teeth together,\" \"long quiet air\") continued to be helpful. Performance is comparable to prior sessions.\n\n4. Final consonants in CVC words and short phrases (imitation)\n- Continued work on final /p/, /t/, and /k/ (\"cup,\" \"hat,\" \"back,\" \"book,\" \"feet\") using simple sentence frames (\"in cup,\" \"on hat,\" \"on back\"). Child produced final consonants reliably in structured imitation. In short phrases, endings were sometimes maintained and sometimes dropped, particularly when the child shifted attention to the game rather than speech. This represents ongoing stabilization rather than a significant change.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue current plan: maintain /k/ at conversational level, and keep targeting /g/ and /s/ at the word and phrase levels, along with final consonants in CVC words and short phrases. Consider formal review of progress and potential adjustment of goals in upcoming block.\n- Home program: caregiver to encourage the child to use complete sentences in daily routines, highlighting /g/ and /s/ words and gently reminding the child to \"finish the word\" for final consonants. Provide positive feedback for clear productions and self-corrections."

            "note_text": "Parent/caregiver report:\n- Parent reported that child is “hard to understand” for unfamiliar listeners and often leaves off sounds at the ends of words. No major changes noted since the initial evaluation. Parent interested in strategies to help at home.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- 4-year-old child transitioned into the therapy room with mild hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance. Once seated, engaged well with toys and picture cards. Attention span was short but could be redirected with visual supports and frequent movement breaks. Followed simple play-based directions with occasional repetition.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: Establish production of /s/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation using snake and train-themed activities. With simultaneous production (SLP and child together), child approximated /s/ in ~4/10 attempts; common substitutions included /t/ and /ʃ/ (“sh”). Required maximal verbal cues (e.g., “long, quiet snake sound”) and mirror for visual feedback. Briefly achieved clearer /s/ when reminded to keep tongue behind teeth, but not yet consistent.\n- Attempted CV syllables (“see, soo, saa”) in imitation; child often reduced to vowel only or used /t/ (“tee” for “see”). Accuracy at this level was low; continued need for intensive modeling.\n\nGoal 2: Final consonant production for /p, t, m/ in CVC words (imitated)\n- Used picture cards and turn-taking game (e.g., “cup, cap, cat, map”). In imitation, child produced final consonants in ~3/10 opportunities. Frequent omissions (“cu” for “cup,” “ma” for “map”). When final consonant was produced, it was generally recognizable. Required maximal verbal cueing (“stop the word,” “put the sound at the end”) and visual cue of SLP touching chin at the last sound.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Introduced /f/ as “lip biting windy sound.” In isolation, child was able to approximate /f/ in 5–6/10 attempts with simultaneous production, but often shifted to /p/ or omitted airflow. Needed repeated reminders to bite lower lip and blow. CV syllables (“fee, foo, faa”) were attempted; most productions were approximations with reduced airflow.\n\nGoal 4: Functional phrase attempts in play\n- During play, child produced single words and word approximations (e.g., “up,” “more,” “mine”). Two-word combinations were rare and largely unintelligible. SLP modeled simple two-word phrases (e.g., “more bubbles,” “my turn”) and child imitated ~4/10 with significant sound distortions, but intent was clear.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to target /s/ and /f/ in isolation and simple syllable shapes with heavy modeling and visual cues.\n- Maintain focus on final consonant production for /p, t, m/ at the imitated word level.\n- Provide parent with demonstration of “long snake sound” (/s/) and “lip biting windy sound” (/f/) to practice a few times daily in front of a mirror, focusing on fun attempts rather than accuracy. Emphasize short, positive practice (1–2 minutes)."

            "note_text": "Parent/caregiver report:\n- Parent noted that child has started trying to copy some of the “snake sound” practice at home but is “hit or miss.” No big changes in intelligibility reported. Parent shared that child is motivated by stickers and pretend play.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered room more readily today and appeared comfortable with clinician. Participated well in structured play tasks for 5–7 minute stretches before needing a break. Some silliness when tasks became challenging (e.g., making animal noises instead of target sounds), but responded to gentle redirection.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Revisited /s/ in isolation with mirror and “quiet snake” imagery. Child produced a recognizable /s/ in isolation in approximately 7/10 imitated attempts with moderate verbal and visual cueing. Less frequent substitution with /t/ noted compared to last session.\n- In CV syllables (“see, soo, saa”), child produced more consistent initial /s/ approximations in ~5/10 trials when given a clear model and reminder to “start with snake, then vowel.” Still occasionally reduced to vowel only but showed increased willingness to attempt.\n\nGoal 2: Final consonants /p, t, m/ in CVC words (imitated)\n- Used picture cards in a turn-taking game. Child produced final consonants more consistently than previous session, approximating final /p, t, m/ in ~5/10 opportunities with moderate verbal cueing (“stop the word”) and modeling. Omissions are still frequent, but occasional spontaneous self-correction noted when provided extra time.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced /f/ with mirror, focusing on biting the lower lip and blowing. Child produced /f/ in isolation in about 6/10 trials with moderate support. Still occasional stopping to /p/, but improved awareness; child sometimes adjusted lip placement after clinician reminder.\n- CV syllables (“fee, foo, faa”) attempted in imitation. Accuracy ~4/10 for clear initial /f/; better control when clinician slowed rate and added tactile cue to lower lip.\n\nGoal 4: Functional two-word phrases in imitation\n- During play with bubbles and cars, SLP modeled simple two-word phrases (e.g., “more bubbles,” “go car,” “my turn”). Child imitated ~6/10 with variable sound accuracy but clearer word boundaries than last session. Intelligibility to clinician improved slightly when context was known.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue current targets with emphasis on /s/ and final consonants; child is showing emerging improvements but not yet ready to move up levels.\n- Encourage parent to keep home practice short and playful, focusing on a few /s/ in isolation attempts and one simple CVC word (e.g., “cup”) per day.\n- Next session: consider adding simple picture choice game to increase motivation while practicing CVC words."

            "note_text": "Parent/caregiver report:\n- Parent reported that child is starting to “hiss” on purpose at home and occasionally tries to say “see” and “so” after modeling. Parent feels some words are “a tiny bit clearer,” especially when they know what child is talking about. No concerns about hearing or general health.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned smoothly into the session and quickly engaged with toys. Demonstrated good joint attention during table-top tasks for longer periods (up to ~10 minutes) with brief movement breaks. Followed simple directions and enjoyed turn-taking games. Mild frustration when unable to produce a sound, but responded well to praise for effort.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: /s/ in isolation, CV, and emerging word level (imitation)\n- In isolation, child produced /s/ accurately in ~8/10 attempts with only light verbal cues. Often able to maintain airflow when reminded “teeth together, tongue behind teeth.”\n- CV syllables (“see, soo, saa, si”) produced with initial /s/ in ~7/10 imitated trials; fewer substitutions and omissions. Child began to anticipate the /s/ and occasionally initiated the sound independently before the model.\n- Briefly introduced imitated word-level /s/ (e.g., “see, sun, soup”). Child produced an initial /s/ approximation in ~5/10 opportunities; errors included /t/ substitution or omission. Performance suggests readiness to continue exploring word-level /s/.\n\nGoal 2: Final consonants /p, t, m/ in CVC words (imitation)\n- Continued practice with picture cards (e.g., “cup, cat, map, mat, mop”). Child produced final consonants in ~7/10 imitated opportunities with moderate cueing, an improvement from previous session. Some spontaneous carryover during play (e.g., “up” with clear /p/ at the end when climbing toy ladder).\n- When cued to “make the word stop,” child occasionally self-corrected from an open syllable (“cu”) to a more complete “cup.”\n\nGoal 3: Initial /f/ in CV and CVC words (imitation)\n- Practiced /f/ in CV syllables (“fee, foo, fa”) and simple words (“fun, four”). Child produced initial /f/ with clearer airflow in ~7/10 CV attempts and ~5/10 word-level attempts. Continued need for mild to moderate verbal cueing, but fewer /p/ substitutions compared to earlier sessions.\n\nGoal 4: Functional two- to three-word phrases (imitation within play)\n- During structured play, SLP modeled two- and simple three-word phrases (“more bubbles please,” “my turn car,” “I want that”). Child imitated ~7/10 phrases with variable speech sound accuracy but more consistent phrase length. Some spontaneous two-word combinations (e.g., “my car,” “more bubbles”) were noted, though often with reduced final consonants.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Given moderate, meaningful gains in /s/ and final consonants, plan to continue strengthening these at the word level next session while still supporting isolation/CV as needed.\n- Encourage parent to practice a few specific words at home (e.g., “see, sun, soup, cup, map”), focusing on slow, clear models and praising attempts rather than perfection.\n- Provide parent with handout describing “stop the word” cue for final consonants."

They feel others can understand the child slightly more, but still need to interpret frequently. Parent has been practicing the “snake sound” and final sounds most evenings.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered room independently and quickly joined clinician at the table. Good participation in both structured and play-based tasks. Needed occasional reminders to wait for their turn but overall cooperative. Enjoyed sticker rewards and verbal praise.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: /s/ initial at word level (imitation and emerging spontaneous)\n- Target words included “sun, soup, sock, see, sit, sand.” In imitation, child produced an initial /s/ or close approximation in ~8/10 trials with light verbal cues. Fewer substitutions with /t/ observed.\n- In structured play, child produced some spontaneous /s/ initial attempts (e.g., “sun,” “sit”) with mixed accuracy; often required a quick reminder to “start with snake sound.” Overall, consistency at the imitated word level has improved.\n\nGoal 2: Final consonants /p, t, m/ in CVC words (imitation and structured play)\n- Continued practice with familiar CVC targets (“cup, cat, map, mat, mop, up”). In imitation, child produced final consonants in ~8/10 trials with minimal to moderate cues. Omissions occurred more often when child was excited or speaking quickly.\n- During play, some spontaneous final consonants were noted in context (e.g., “up,” “pop”) with good clarity. Child is beginning to show awareness when a final sound is missing, especially when the SLP uses a questioning look.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /f/ at word level (imitation)\n- Focused on words such as “fun, four, food, feet.” Child imitated initial /f/ correctly in ~7/10 opportunities with mild verbal reminders to “bite lip and blow.” Occasional reversion to /p/ still present but less frequent. When slowed down and given a visual model, accuracy improved.\n\nGoal 4: Short functional phrases (2–3 words) with targeted sounds\n- SLP modeled phrases incorporating target words (e.g., “more soup,” “big sun,” “my feet,” “cup up”). Child imitated ~7/10 phrases with reasonable approximations of target sounds. Some spontaneous two-word phrases appeared in play (“my car,” “more bubbles,” “up please”), though sound production remained variable.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Child is demonstrating moderate, meaningful progress and is beginning to stabilize /s/ and final consonants at the word level. Plan to continue consolidating these targets and gradually expand to simple carrier phrases for highly familiar /s/ and CVC words.\n- Recommend parent continue home practice with a small set of familiar words and short phrases, emphasizing slow, clear models and celebrating attempts.\n- Next session: trial simple carrier phrases (e.g., “I see ___,” “my ___”) with /s/ initial words if accuracy remains stable."

No new concerns raised.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child was somewhat distracted at the start of the session, interested in toys outside the therapy area. After a short transition activity, attention improved and child participated adequately in structured tasks. Occasional avoidance (changing topic or making silly noises) when a task became challenging, but responded to breaks and encouragement.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: /s/ initial at word and emerging phrase level\n- Practiced familiar /s/ initial words (“sun, soup, sit, sock, see”). In imitation, child maintained similar accuracy to last session, producing initial /s/ in ~8/10 trials with light cues. Occasional /t/ substitution persisted, especially when speaking more quickly.\n- Introduced simple carrier phrases (e.g., “I see sun,” “I see soup”) with strong modeling. Child imitated these phrases with correct or near-correct initial /s/ in ~5/10 opportunities. Still required moderate support to maintain /s/ when moving from single words to phrases.\n\nGoal 2: Final consonants /p, t, m/ in CVC words (imitation and structured play)\n- Continued with familiar CVC targets. In imitation, child produced final consonants in ~8/10 attempts, similar to prior session. Errors mainly occurred when child was less attentive or rushed. In play, some spontaneous final consonants were heard (e.g., “up,” “cup”), but not consistently across words.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /f/ at word level (imitation)\n- Target words included “feet, four, fun, food.” Child imitated initial /f/ with similar accuracy to previous session (~7/10). Needed intermittent verbal reminders for lip placement. When focused, productions were clear; when distracted, accuracy decreased.\n\nGoal 4: Short functional phrases with targeted words\n- Continued to model 2–3 word phrases containing target words (e.g., “my feet,” “big sun,” “cup up”). Child imitated ~6/10 with approximate sound accuracy. Spontaneous phrase use was present but not markedly different from last week.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Skills appear relatively stable this week, with consolidation of word-level /s/, final consonants, and /f/. Child is still adjusting to using targets in phrases.\n- Plan to continue practicing current targets at the same levels next session, emphasizing consistency and attention to the final sounds.\n- Encourage parent to keep home practice brief and positive, focusing on a few familiar /s/ words and final consonant CVC words during daily routines (e.g., snack time: “cup,” “sip,” “mop”)."

They feel there is a “small but noticeable” improvement in how easily family members understand the child.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned well and appeared eager to show skills. Sat for structured tasks for longer stretches with fewer redirections needed. Enjoyed turn-taking games and responded positively to specific praise (e.g., “I heard your good /s/!”).\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: /s/ initial at word and carrier phrase level (imitation, emerging independence)\n- Word level: child produced initial /s/ in familiar words (“sun, soup, sit, sock, see, soap”) accurately in ~9/10 imitated trials with minimal cueing. Occasional errors were self-corrected after a brief pause.\n- Carrier phrases: practiced “I see ___” and “my ___” with /s/ initial words. Child imitated phrases with correct /s/ in ~8/10 opportunities. Began to produce short phrases with /s/ (e.g., “see sun”) more spontaneously within play when given picture choices.\n\nGoal 2: Final consonants /p, t, m/ in CVC words (imitation and structured play)\n- Child maintained good performance for familiar CVC words, producing final consonants in ~9/10 imitated trials with minimal prompts. In structured play, child produced final consonants more consistently across words, including some less practiced items. Occasional omissions still occurred, but child sometimes corrected after the SLP’s visual cue.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /f/ at word and simple phrase level (imitation)\n- Word level targets (“feet, four, fun, food, fan”). Child produced initial /f/ correctly in ~8/10 imitated attempts with light cueing. Demonstrated better control of airflow and lip placement.\n- Simple phrases (“my feet,” “four fish,” “fun food”) were introduced. Child imitated with reasonably accurate /f/ in ~6/10 trials. Needed extra support to maintain /f/ when adding more words.\n\nGoal 4: Functional 2–3 word phrases incorporating targets\n- Within play-based routines (e.g., feeding toy animals, driving cars), SLP modeled and elicited short phrases such as “my cup,” “big sun,” “more soup,” “four fish.” Child imitated ~8/10 modeled phrases and produced several spontaneous two-word combinations with target words (e.g., “my cup,” “more soup”), though sound accuracy varied.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Child is demonstrating emerging improvement with increased accuracy and some self-corrections. Plan to continue expanding /s/ and final consonant use in short phrases, while stabilizing /f/ at word level and beginning more phrase-level practice.\n- Recommend parent practice simple carrier phrases at home (“I see sun,” “my sock”) using picture books or daily routines.\n- Next session: consider trialing very simple play-based conversation prompts to encourage more spontaneous use of target sounds in short utterances."

Enjoyed being the “teacher” and giving the clinician a turn to say target words.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: /s/ initial in short sentences and structured conversation\n- Continued work with short sentences and simple question/answer exchanges involving /s/ words (e.g., “I see the sun,” “Where is the sock?” “The sock is here.”). Child produced initial /s/ accurately in ~8–9/10 imitated sentences, consistent with prior performance.\n- In brief structured conversation about pictures (e.g., describing what they see), child attempted /s/ in many initial positions with moderate overall accuracy, though not yet at conversational consistency.\n\nGoal 2: Final consonants /p, t, m/ in sentences and simple dialogue\n- Practiced short exchanges like “I want cup,” “Put it up,” “Tap it,” “Mom is up.” Child produced final consonants accurately in ~8/10 imitated sentences. In simple back-and-forth questions and answers, final consonant presence varied but was more frequent than in early sessions.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /f/ in sentences and short conversational turns\n- Sentences such as “My feet are wet,” “Four fish are here,” “This is fun food” were practiced. Child produced initial /f/ in ~7–8/10 imitated sentences with light cues. No major change in performance from prior week.\n\nGoal 4: Overall intelligibility in semi-structured play\n- In a semi-structured play activity (pretend grocery store), child used multiple 2–5 word utterances to request items and comment. Intelligibility to clinician remained fairly good with contextual support, though breakdowns still occurred with longer or less familiar words.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Skills continue to appear stable. Child is maintaining gains but not yet showing a clear leap in independence at the conversational level.\n- Plan to keep practicing /s/, /f/, and final consonants in short sentence and semi-structured conversation tasks, focusing on slowing rate and self-monitoring.\n- Recommend parent reinforce child’s self-awareness by responding positively when child asks “Was that good?” and, if appropriate, briefly model a slightly clearer version without overcorrecting."

They continue to hear better /s/ and final sounds in practiced words, but general conversation is still sometimes difficult for unfamiliar listeners.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered session in a good mood and was eager to talk. Some impulsive responding (speaking before model was finished), but generally redirectable. Enjoyed role-play games and took turns well.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: /s/ initial in sentences and structured conversation\n- Continued practice with sentence-level /s/ in picture description and simple question/answer tasks. Child produced initial /s/ accurately in ~8–9/10 imitated sentences, similar to recent sessions.\n- In structured conversation about daily activities (e.g., “I see my socks,” “I see sun outside”), child attempted /s/ in many appropriate places with moderate accuracy. No marked change in overall performance.\n\nGoal 2: Final consonants /p, t, m/ in connected speech\n- Used short story and role-play activities to elicit CVC words in context. Child produced final consonants reliably in practiced phrases and sentences (~8/10), with some carryover into less structured utterances. Omissions still present, especially when child was more animated.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /f/ in functional phrases and sentences\n- Practiced functional phrases such as “my feet are cold,” “four fish here,” “this is fun.” Child produced /f/ correctly in ~7–8/10 imitated sentences, requiring occasional reminders for lip placement. Performance consistent with previous weeks.\n\nGoal 4: Intelligibility and self-monitoring\n- During play, child produced numerous 2–5 word utterances. Intelligibility to clinician remained improved compared to the start of the block, though still variable without context. Child occasionally paused and tried again after an unclear production, indicating growing self-monitoring.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- This appears to be another consolidation week with relatively stable performance.\n- Plan to maintain focus on sentence-level practice and structured conversation with /s/, /f/, and final consonants, while supporting self-monitoring strategies (e.g., “Did that sound right?” checks).\n- Encourage parent to provide gentle feedback at home by occasionally repeating back the child’s sentence with clear target sounds, emphasizing understanding and communication first."

They feel that family members generally understand the child in familiar contexts, but new listeners still have difficulty. Parent is pleased with the progress so far and is interested in next steps.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child was cheerful and cooperative throughout the session. Participated actively in all tasks and enjoyed more “grown-up” conversation-style activities. Demonstrated good rapport with clinician and responded well to feedback.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: /s/ initial in sentences and semi-structured conversation\n- Practiced sentence-level /s/ in story-telling and picture description (e.g., “I see the sun at the park,” “My sock is on,” “She sits on the sand”). Child produced initial /s/ accurately in ~8–9/10 imitated sentences, comparable to recent sessions.\n- In semi-structured conversation about favorite games and routines, child used /s/ in many appropriate words with moderate accuracy; some productions were clear, others showed residual errors.\n\nGoal 2: Final consonants /p, t, m/ in connected speech\n- Through storybook reading and role-play, child produced many CVC words with final /p, t, m/ in context. Accuracy remained strong for practiced words when given mild cueing, with omissions appearing more in longer or less familiar words. Overall performance consistent with prior weeks.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /f/ in connected speech\n- Used functional sentences involving /f/ words (e.g., “My feet are on the floor,” “Four fish swim,” “This is fun food”). Child produced initial /f/ correctly in ~7–8/10 imitated sentences, with similar accuracy in supported conversational turns when reminded to slow down.\n\nGoal 4: Overall intelligibility and functional communication\n- In a mix of structured and play-based activities, child generated multiple 3–6 word utterances. Intelligibility to clinician was generally fair to good with contextual support, though still below age expectations in more complex or less predictable contexts. Child showed good communicative intent, used gestures and repetition to repair breakdowns, and remained engaged.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Skills appear stable at the current level, with maintained gains in /s/, /f/, and final consonants at the word and sentence level, and partial carryover to connected speech.\n- Recommend continued therapy to support further generalization to spontaneous conversation and to increase consistency with new and longer words.\n- Home practice: continue short daily practice with a mix of sentence-level /s/ and /f/ targets and CVC words in simple phrases, embedded in books, routines, and play. Encourage child’s self-monitoring by asking, “Can you try that one more time with your snake sound?” when appropriate."

No formal practice of specific sounds at home yet. No concerns with hearing or overall health.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned into the therapy room with mild hesitation but separated from mother with verbal reassurance. Once in the room, he engaged well with toys and was generally cooperative. Attention span was typical for age; required intermittent redirection back to tasks when play became more self-directed.\n\nGoals/therapy activities:\n1. Establish baseline for speech sound production\n- Informal play-based speech sample collected. Intelligibility to unfamiliar listener estimated at ~60% in conversation. Noted frequent omission of final consonants (e.g., \"pi\" for \"pig\"), stopping of /f/ and /s/ to /p/ and /t/, and reduction of /s/ blends (e.g., \"lide\" for \"slide\").\n- Syllable structures observed included CV, CVC, and some CVCV forms; multisyllabic words often simplified.\n\n2. Initial /f/ at isolation and syllable level (imitation)\n- Introduced \"quiet bunny teeth\" cue for /f/ in front of mirror. Child was able to approximate /f/ in isolation intermittently with maximal verbal and visual cues (lip placement, airflow), but frequently substituted /p/ or added a vowel (\"fuh\").\n- In CV syllables (\"fee, foo, fah\"), productions were mostly stopped to /p/ with occasional accurate attempts when given slow models and visual attention to clinician's mouth.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple syllables (imitation)\n- Used snake visuals and hissing sound to elicit /s/. Child produced a prolonged /s/ in isolation inconsistently; often inserted a small \"t\" or \"d\" (\"ts\").\n- In CV syllables (\"see, soo\"), accuracy was low; productions often sounded like /t/ or /d/ plus vowel (\"dee\"). Required maximal modeling and gestural cues for tongue placement.\n\n4. Final consonant awareness at word level (listening task)\n- Played a listening game contrasting words with and without final consonants (e.g., \"bee\" vs. \"beep\"). Child could usually point to the picture that matched the clinician's production but did not yet reliably mark final consonants in his own speech.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to target /f/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables with high levels of support next session.\n- Introduce simple final consonant practice in highly motivating CVC words.\n- Home program: mother encouraged to model slow, clear /f/ and /s/ in daily routines (e.g., \"fish, food, soap\"), drawing attention to her mouth, without pressuring the child to imitate yet."

She noted that preschool staff still find him \"hard to understand\" in group settings.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered the room willingly and appeared comfortable. He was curious about new toys and participated well in structured games. Needed occasional prompts to wait his turn and listen to instructions but remained generally cooperative throughout.\n\nGoals/therapy activities:\n1. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)\n- Continued use of mirror and \"bunny teeth\" cue. Child produced /f/ in isolation with improved consistency when given a model and verbal cue; still required frequent reminders but showed clearer airflow and lip placement.\n- In CV syllables (\"fee, foo, fa\"), approximations were more frequent, with fewer substitutions to /p/. Accuracy remained inconsistent but higher than last session, particularly for \"fee\" and \"foo\" during focused practice.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)\n- Used snake puppet and visual cue of tongue behind teeth. Child was able to hold a continuous /s/ for short durations with direct imitation. Still occasionally added a small /t/ onset but seemed more aware when clinician pointed it out.\n- In CV syllables (\"see, soo, sah\"), productions were a mix of /s/ and /d/ substitutions. Slight increase in accurate /s/ productions compared to baseline, especially when given extra time to prepare and watch the clinician.\n\n3. Early awareness of final consonants in CVC words (imitation)\n- Practiced a small set of CVC words (e.g., \"cup, map, beep\") with picture support. Child continued to omit many final consonants in spontaneous attempts but could sometimes add the final sound after a direct model and cue (\"say 'cup'—don't forget the /p/ at the end\").\n- Demonstrated emerging ability to repeat final /p/ and /m/ with heavy support, though carryover to less structured play was minimal.\n\n4. Functional word attempts in play\n- During play, child used many single words and short phrases. Some spontaneous words were clear (e.g., \"more,\" \"my turn\") while others were difficult to understand due to final consonant deletion and substitutions.\n- Accepted clinician recasts and did not show frustration when asked to try a word again.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue at current level for /f/ and /s/ (isolation and CV syllables) to build consistency.\n- Maintain focus on a small set of CVC words with visible final consonants (e.g., /p, m/) using picture supports.\n- Home: parent encouraged to pick 3–4 practice words (e.g., \"feet, food, soap, cup\") and practice briefly during daily routines, keeping it playful and short."

He maintained attention well for turn-taking games and responded positively to specific praise. Mild silliness at times but easily redirected back to task.\n\nGoals/therapy activities:\n1. Initial /f/ in CV and CVC words (imitation, emerging independence)\n- Practiced /f/ in CV syllables and a small set of high-interest CVC words (\"feet, fish, fun\"). Child produced /f/ in CV syllables with noticeably improved consistency following a model, needing fewer verbal cues for placement.\n- In CVC words, he was able to maintain initial /f/ in several attempts, though final consonant deletion was still present (e.g., \"fi\" for \"fish\"). Demonstrated emerging self-correction when clinician gently reminded him of \"bunny teeth\".\n\n2. Initial /s/ in CV syllables and simple CVC words (imitation)\n- Used snake puppet and visual cues. Child produced /s/ in CV syllables (\"see, soo, suh\") with slightly increased accuracy. He showed more attempts to sustain the /s/ without adding a /t/ or /d/ onset.\n- Introduced a few simple CVC words with initial /s/ (\"sun, soup\"). Accuracy was variable; he often substituted /d/ or reduced the word. With slow modeling and gesture, he achieved some clearer productions.\n\n3. Final consonant marking in CVC words (imitation with segmentation)\n- Continued work on CVC words with focus on final /p/ and /m/ (\"map, mop, nap, mom\"). Used segmenting strategy (\"mmm-aaa-p, map\"). Child showed slightly more success adding the final consonant immediately after the clinician's segmented model.\n- Spontaneous productions in play still often lacked final consonants, but within structured drills he was more willing to attempt full CVC shapes.\n\n4. Functional phrases in play (imitation)\n- Modeled short functional phrases (\"my turn,\" \"more please,\" \"I want ___\"). Child imitated 2–3 word phrases in the majority of opportunities, though speech clarity varied. Clinician provided recasts and gentle reminders for target sounds within these phrases when appropriate.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue with /f/ in initial CV and simple CVC words; consider increasing the number of CVC words if consistency remains.\n- Maintain /s/ practice at CV level and a small selection of CVC words.\n- Home: parent encouraged to focus on a few \"/f/ words\" (e.g., \"feet, food, fish\") during routines and to pause briefly to allow child to try the word after hearing a clear model."

Child produced initial /f/ consistently when provided with a model and brief reminder; performance was similar to recent sessions.\n- Maintained /f/ in short phrases (\"big fish,\" \"my food\") with moderate support. Continued omission of final consonants in many words.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in CVC words and brief exposure to /s/ blends (imitation, listening)\n- Targeted /s/ words (\"sun, soup, sock, sand\") with picture support. Word-level accuracy remained variable but generally stable.\n- Briefly introduced /s/ blends in a listening game (e.g., \"star\" vs. \"tar\"). Child could sometimes identify when the /s/ was present but was not yet asked to produce blends consistently.\n\n3. Final consonants in CVC words (imitation)\n- Used a simple board game to practice final /p, t, m/. Child produced some accurate CVC words with full final consonants when highly supported, but spontaneous speech remained characterized by frequent final consonant deletion.\n- No notable change in level of cueing needed compared to previous weeks.\n\n4. Functional phrases and overall intelligibility\n- Encouraged 2–3 word phrases in play, such as \"my turn,\" \"go fast,\" \"more bubbles.\" Child willingly used phrases, and clinician could generally interpret his meaning, though clarity was still reduced for unfamiliar listeners.\n- Provided recasts and reinforcement for any clearer productions of target sounds.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Maintain current goals and practice structure as skills continue to consolidate.\n- Continue to monitor readiness to expand /s/ practice to include simple blends once single /s/ becomes more consistent.\n- Home: parent encouraged to keep practice short and fun, focusing on a few favorite /f/ and /s/ words and praising effort rather than perfection."

He followed simple directions and participated well in structured and play-based tasks. Needed occasional reminders to wait for his turn to speak.\n\nGoals/therapy activities:\n1. Initial /f/ in CVC words and short phrases (imitation)\n- Reviewed /f/ words (\"fish, feet, food, fun\") in a simple card game. Child continued to show consistent production of initial /f/ when cued, similar to previous sessions.\n- In short phrases (\"my fish,\" \"fun food\"), he maintained /f/ in many attempts but still omitted some final consonants.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in CVC words and short phrases (imitation)\n- Practiced /s/ words (\"sun, soup, sock, sand, soap\") with picture scenes. Accuracy remained variable, with some clear /s/ productions and some substitutions. Overall performance was comparable to prior sessions.\n- Imitated short phrases (\"sun up,\" \"sock on,\" \"soap here\") with moderate support; no major changes in cueing needs were noted.\n\n3. Final consonants in CVC words (imitation)\n- Continued targeted practice for final /p, t, m/ using tapping and segmented models. Child produced several accurate CVC forms in structured practice but did not yet generalize this consistently.\n- Skills at this level appeared stable, with isolated accurate productions but limited carryover.\n\n4. Functional communication in play\n- Child used multiword utterances (2–4 words) throughout play. The clinician relied on context and familiarity with his patterns to interpret some less intelligible utterances.\n- Provided positive feedback for any clearer productions and reinforced attempts at target sounds.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue current targets with a focus on consistency and gradual reduction in cues when possible.\n- Consider more explicit self-monitoring strategies (e.g., \"did you hear the end of that word?\") in upcoming sessions.\n- Home: encourage parent to gently prompt for \"finished words\" once or twice per routine, without overcorrecting."

Reported that preschool teachers sometimes have difficulty understanding the child.\n- No recent changes in health or hearing reported.\n\n2. Behaviour/engagement observations:\n- Child transitioned into the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance.\n- Became more comfortable after a few minutes of play; participated well with frequent encouragement and visual supports.\n- Attention span was variable; needed redirection back to tasks when toys were highly motivating.\n\n3. Therapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: Establish /f/ in isolation and simple syllables (baseline)\n- Introduced /f/ as a “quiet lip-bite, windy sound.”\n- In isolation, child produced /f/ accurately in approximately half of opportunities with simultaneous modeling and mirror support; frequent substitution or omission noted.\n- In CV syllables (e.g., \"fa, fee, foo\"), accuracy was low and required maximal visual/verbal cueing and hand-over-hand support to position the lower lip.\n\nGoal 2: Establish /s/ in isolation and initial syllables (baseline)\n- Child demonstrated lateral airflow and occasional /sh/-like productions for /s/.\n- With close imitation and cueing to “keep the tongue behind the teeth and blow,” child was able to approximate /s/ in isolation inconsistently.\n- Attempted CV syllables (\"see, soo\"); productions were mostly distorted or substituted with /sh/ or /th/.\n\nGoal 3: Probe /s/-blends at word level (baseline)\n- Introduced a small set of /s/ blends (e.g., \"spoon, star, slide\") in play.\n- Child typically omitted the /s/ or simplified the cluster (e.g., \"poon\" for \"spoon,\" \"tar\" for \"star\").\n- Able to repeat a few blends with heavy simultaneous modeling, but productions were not yet consistent.\n\nGoal 4: Overall speech sound profile in play\n- During free play and simple picture description, child’s speech was reduced in intelligibility, especially in multisyllabic words and words with clusters.\n- Noted inconsistent final consonant productions; some final sounds were present, but deletions occurred in conversation.\n\n4. Plan/recommendations:\n- Plan to continue establishing accurate /f/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables before moving consistently to word level.\n- Caregiver encouraged to model slow, clear speech at home and highlight /f/ and /s/ words during daily routines (e.g., “fish, food, soap, sun”) without asking for repeated practice yet.\n- Will monitor tolerance for more structured drill tasks and gradually increase demands as comfort improves."

Behaviour/engagement observations:\n- Child separated smoothly from caregiver and entered room without difficulty.\n- Highly engaged with turn-taking games and tolerated structured practice for short bursts.\n- Needed occasional movement breaks but returned to task with minimal prompting.\n\n3. Therapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Reviewed /f/ in isolation with mirror. Child produced a clear /f/ in most attempts when reminded to bite the lip and blow; fewer substitutions compared to baseline.\n- In CV syllables (\"fee, foo, fa\"), productions were more consistent with moderate verbal and visual cues. Occasional backing to /h/ or omission still present, but there was clearer airflow and better lip placement overall.\n\nGoal 2: /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on tongue placement and airflow. Child showed more consistent ability to imitate a close approximation of /s/ when watching the clinician’s mouth.\n- In CV syllables (\"see, soo, saa\"), accuracy remained variable but improved slightly. Needed repeated modeling and cues to keep tongue inside the mouth and teeth mostly closed.\n\nGoal 3: /s/ blends – imitation at word level (probe/early practice)\n- Targeted a small set of /s/-blends (\"star, spoon, slide, spider\") with picture support.\n- Child continued to frequently omit /s\" (e.g., \"tar,\" \"pider\"), but there were a few emerging attempts where the /s/ was audible with simultaneous modeling.\n- Required maximal verbal cueing (\"use your snake sound first\") and visual emphasis on the /s/ portion of the blend.\n\nGoal 4: Final consonant awareness (informal)\n- During play, clinician highlighted final sounds in short CVC words (\"bus, cup, dog\").\n- Child was able to identify when the clinician left off the final sound in some cases, indicating growing awareness, though independent productions remained inconsistent.\n\n4. Plan/recommendations:\n- Continue to solidify /f/ in isolation and syllables; begin to introduce high-frequency /f/ words (e.g., \"food, fish\") in structured imitation next session if accuracy remains similar.\n- Maintain focus on /s/ in isolation with careful modeling; continue light introduction of /s/ blends as exposure only.\n- Parent encouraged to continue labeling and emphasizing /f/ words at home and to praise any clear /f/ sounds they notice without asking for repeated corrections."

Therapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: /f/ initial – transition to word level (imitation)\n- Practiced initial /f/ words (\"fish, foot, food, fan, four\") in imitation.\n- Child produced initial /f/ with good lip placement in most trials when given a model first; fewer substitutions to /p/ or /h/ compared to prior sessions.\n- Occasional need for reminders to “bite your lip then blow.” Some spontaneous correct /f/ productions occurred during game play when labeling pictures.\n\nGoal 2: /s/ isolation and syllables – increasing consistency\n- Reviewed /s/ in isolation with visual cues. Child was more consistent in shaping a central airflow sound with tongue behind the teeth, though mild distortion persisted.\n- In CV syllables (\"see, soo, saa\"), child achieved more frequent accurate or near-accurate productions with moderate verbal/visual cues.\n- Child began to self-correct on a few trials after hearing their own error.\n\nGoal 3: Early /s/ blends – imitated word level\n- Targeted a small set of /s/-blends (\"spoon, star, slide, spin\") in imitation.\n- Child produced blends with partially audible /s/ in several attempts when words were broken into parts (e.g., \"s\" + \"poon\") and then blended.\n- Still frequently reduced clusters, but there was clearer evidence of the /s/ component than in previous sessions. Backward chaining (starting with the vowel and adding consonants) was helpful.\n\nGoal 4: Functional carryover – intelligibility in play\n- During play-based tasks, overall intelligibility to the clinician remained reduced but slightly improved for words practiced in drills (e.g., \"fish,\" \"food\").\n- Child was eager to be understood and repeated themselves when requested.\n\n4. Plan/recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen initial /f/ at the word level in imitation; begin to probe for short carrier phrases (e.g., “my fish”) if consistency holds.\n- Maintain focus on /s/ in isolation and syllables, gradually increasing the number of practice trials.\n- Continue using backward chaining for /s/-blends; keep them at the imitated word level for now.\n- Parent encouraged to practice a small set of /f/ words at home (2–3 minutes, once or twice daily) using a picture list provided, focusing on slow, clear productions with lots of praise."

Plan/recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on refining /s/ in isolation and simple syllables; continue to emphasize consistent tongue position.\n- Keep initial /s/ words and /s/-blends at the imitated word level until accuracy stabilizes.\n- Continue monitoring /f/ in spontaneous speech but shift active therapy time more toward /s/ and clusters.\n- Parent encouraged to keep providing positive feedback for any clear /s/ attempts and to avoid pressuring the child to repeat errors multiple times."

Parent/caregiver report:\n- Parent shared that child recently started preschool full-days and teachers have commented that speech is easier to understand than at the start of the year, especially for /f/ words.\n- Parent has noticed a few clearer /s/ sounds in words like “sun” and “sock” when child is speaking slowly.\n\n2. Behaviour/engagement observations:\n- Child transitioned well despite schedule changes with preschool.\n- Demonstrated increased maturity in following multi-step directions and staying with structured tasks.\n- Showed good perseverance, even on more challenging /s/ activities.\n\n3. Therapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: /f/ – generalization check\n- Brief probe of /f/ in new vocabulary and spontaneous conversation.\n- Child produced accurate /f/ across a variety of words and sentence contexts with no direct cueing.\n- /f/ appears well-established and generalized to functional speech for the contexts sampled today.\n\nGoal 2: /s/ in isolation and syllables – increased consistency\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation using mirror, visual cues, and auditory feedback.\n- Child showed noticeably more consistent, central /s/ productions and was better able to self-monitor when the sound “didn’t feel right.”\n- In CV syllables and VC syllables (\"see, soo, iss, us\"), child achieved clearer productions more frequently, requiring somewhat less cueing than in prior weeks.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /s/ words – imitated word level, expanding set\n- Targeted an expanded set of initial /s/ words (\"sun, soup, sock, soap, seal, sand, sad, sing\").\n- Child produced a clearer /s/ at the start of many words with visual/verbal cues and occasional use of a slow rate.\n- Accuracy and consistency showed meaningful improvement compared to earlier sessions, with fewer distorted or substituted productions.\n\nGoal 4: /s/-blends – imitated word level, shaping sequences\n- Continued practicing /s/-blends (\"spoon, star, slide, spin, stop, snow\").\n- Child benefitted from backward chaining (e.g., \"tar\" → \"star\"; \"no\" → \"snow\"). More blends contained an audible, reasonably clear /s/ component than in past sessions.\n- Still needed moderate support, but overall accuracy and independence were noticeably improved.\n\n4. Plan/recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on /s/ in isolation, syllables, and initial /s/ words, with the goal of preparing to move into short phrases for high-confidence /s/ words.\n- Maintain structured /s/-blend work at the imitated word level while gradually increasing difficulty as tolerated.\n- Given strong generalization of /f/, /f/ will remain a monitoring target rather than a primary therapy focus.\n- Parent encouraged to practice a small set of initial /s/ words at home using a picture list, emphasizing slow, clear productions and praising effort."

            "note_text": "Session 1\nChild age: 4 years\n\nParent/Caregiver Report:\n- Mother reported that the pediatrician suggested monitoring speech clarity, especially with “s” and “f” sounds. She noted that family members understand the child most of the time, but peers and unfamiliar listeners often ask for repetitions.\n- No concerns about hearing or overall health. Parent shared that the child will be starting JK in the fall and she would like speech to be clearer by then.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from mother without tears.\n- Initially quiet and observed the clinician, then warmed up with preferred toys (cars, animals). Responded well to playful, game-based tasks.\n- Attention span was variable; needed frequent redirection back to the table from free play but was generally cooperative.\n\nTherapy Goals & Observations:\nGoal 1: Establish /f/ in isolation and simple syllables (imitation)\n- Baseline probing revealed frequent substitutions of /p/ or /b/ for /f/ in words (e.g., “pish” for “fish”).\n- In isolation, child was able to approximate /f/ with visual modeling (\"bite lip, blow air\") in about half of attempts; often added a voice or stopped the airflow.\n- In simple CV syllables (\"foo, fah, fee\"), productions were mostly inaccurate without cues. With direct imitation and visual cueing (mirror and clinician model), a few clear productions were noted but not yet consistent.\n\nGoal 2: Establish /s/ in isolation and at the imitated syllable level\n- Child tended to produce /d/ or /sh/ for /s/ (e.g., “done” for “sun” in conversation).\n- In isolation, with a “snake sound” cue and visual model, child approximated a prolonged /s/ a few times but had difficulty maintaining airflow and tongue position.\n- At the syllable level (\"see, soo, sah\"), accuracy was low; most attempts were distorted or shifted to /sh/ or /d/. Required maximal verbal and visual cueing.\n\nGoal 3: Baseline for /s/ blends at the word level\n- Probed /s/ blends in initial position (e.g., \"star, spoon, slide, snake\") in imitation.\n- Child consistently reduced blends by omitting /s/ or the second consonant (e.g., “tar” for “star,” “poon” for “spoon”).\n- Even with segmented modeling (\"s- tar\"), child had difficulty coordinating both sounds. No independent accurate productions observed today.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to focus on establishing accurate /f/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables with heavy visual and verbal cueing.\n- Introduce parent to simple cues: \"bite your lip and blow\" for /f/, and \"quiet snake sound\" for /s/ with tongue behind teeth.\n- Encourage parent to model, not drill, during play (e.g., emphasize target sounds in key words like “fish, fun, sun, sock”).\n- Next session: re-check isolation for /f/ and /s/, and begin more structured CV practice if accuracy improves."

She has been trying the “snake sound” and “bite lip” cues at home but feels the child is mostly just watching her, not copying yet.\n- She noticed that the child is starting to correct “pish” to something closer to “fish” once in a while during bath time play.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child separated easily from mother today and appeared more comfortable in the therapy space.\n- Participated well in turn-taking games and tolerated short table-top tasks between play activities.\n- Some impulsivity (grabbing toys, moving quickly between activities), but could be redirected with clear expectations and visual supports.\n\nTherapy Goals & Observations:\nGoal 1: /f/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)\n- With mirror and visual cueing, child produced a clearer /f/ in isolation in the majority of attempts when given time to set up the mouth position.\n- Still occasionally voiced or switched to /p/, but there were more clearly recognizable /f/ productions than last week.\n- In CV syllables (\"fee, foo, fah, fuh\"), child achieved a mix of accurate and approximate productions with modeling. Needed moderate verbal cueing (“bite your lip, blow slowly”). Some emerging consistency compared to baseline.\n\nGoal 2: /s/ in isolation and simple syllables (imitation)\n- Child responded well to the “snake” metaphor. With sustained modeling, could hold a short /s/ for a second or two several times.\n- Still tends to let the tongue come forward, producing a slightly slushy sound, but this was less frequent than last session.\n- In CV syllables (\"see, soo, sah\"), accuracy remained limited; some attempts were closer to /s/, others shifted to /sh/ or /d/. Required maximal cues and slow practice.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /f/ in single words (imitation)\n- Introduced a few high-interest /f/ words (\"fish, fun, five, food\") in a picture game.\n- Child imitated initial /f/ accurately in a small number of attempts when given clear modeling and time to prepare, though many productions were still approximations or substitutions.\n- Parent coached in-session on how to provide the same cueing at home.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue practicing /f/ in isolation and CV syllables; maintain word-level practice only when accuracy is acceptable at the syllable level.\n- Keep /s/ focus at isolation and simple CV practice; not yet ready to move consistently to word-level.\n- Home program: parent to practice a few /f/ words (fish, fun) in play-based routines, praising effort and clear sounds rather than drilling.\n- Next session: reassess /f/ word-level and consider adding a few more functional /f/ words if consistency continues to improve."

Child able to produce a longer, more focused /s/ with moderate verbal and visual cues.\n- CV syllables (\"see, soo, suh\") were somewhat more consistent than last session, though distortions persisted.\n- Briefly probed a few initial /s/ words (sun, soup, sock) in imitation. Child often produced /d/ or /sh/ instead; will continue to focus on strengthening the sound in isolation/syllables before extended word-level practice.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue building consistency for /f/ in phrases, gradually reducing cues and increasing variety of phrases.\n- Maintain /s/ at isolation and syllable levels, with occasional short probes at the word level to monitor readiness.\n- Home practice: encourage daily use of a few /f/ phrases (e.g., “my fish,” “five fish”) during play, and keep modeling clear /s/ in simple “snake” games without pressuring the child to imitate every time."

Occasional errors occurred in less familiar /f/ words but were infrequent.\n\nGoal 2: Maintain /f/ in mixed contexts (initial and some medial positions)\n- Introduced a few medial /f/ words (sofa, coffee in pretend play) in imitation.\n- Child could approximate medial /f/ with support, though this was more challenging than initial position.\n- Focus remained on consolidating strong initial /f/ performance while beginning to expose the child to other word positions.\n\nGoal 3: /s/ in isolation, CV syllables, and initial word-level (imitation)\n- Continued intensive practice on /s/ isolation. Child able to produce a more stable “snake” sound when watching in the mirror and following tongue placement cues.\n- CV syllables (\"see, soo, say, suh\") were more consistent, though still not fully accurate.\n- At the word level (sun, soup, sock, soap), child continued to show a mix of /d/, /sh/, and improved /s/-like attempts. A few clearer /s/ productions were noted with maximal cueing and slow rate, suggesting slow but steady gains.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating /f/ at sentence level and in structured conversation; consider adding more varied vocabulary and positions once stability is confirmed.\n- Maintain targeted practice for /s/ at isolation and syllable levels, with limited high-support word practice.\n- Home practice: parent to encourage the child to use “f” words in short phrases during everyday activities and to play simple mirror games for “snake sounds” 2–3 times per week."

Needed minimal prompts to stay seated during short drill segments.\n- Seemed proud of speech successes and responded well to specific praise.\n\nTherapy Goals & Observations:\nGoal 1: Maintain /f/ accuracy in connected speech\n- Used open-ended play scenes and picture description to elicit spontaneous sentences with /f/ words.\n- Child maintained clear initial /f/ in familiar words (fish, five, food, fun) in most spontaneous utterances.\n- Occasional errors in new /f/ words were quickly corrected with a brief verbal reminder. Skills appear to be consolidating at this level.\n\nGoal 2: /s/ in isolation and syllables; expand to more systematic word-level practice\n- Continued “snake sound” practice with mirror. Child produced a clearer, more consistent /s/ with moderate cues.\n- Practiced CV and VC syllables (\"see, soo, iss, us\") with improved control. Distortions were reduced but still present intermittently.\n- At the word level (sun, soap, sock, soup, sad), child demonstrated a mix of approximations and substitutions. A few words were produced with a closer-to-target /s/ following detailed cueing (e.g., “teeth together, blow air”). Emerging improvement noted but not yet reliable.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /s/ blends (baseline probe)\n- Briefly probed /s/ blends (stop, spin, star, spoon) at the imitated word level.\n- Child typically reduced blends (e.g., “top” for “stop,” “tar” for “star”).\n- Given the ongoing work on single /s/, blends will remain a longer-term target.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to monitor /f/ in conversation and maintain opportunities for practice in longer phrases and varied contexts.\n- Keep primary focus on strengthening /s/ at isolation and syllable levels, with supported word practice.\n- Home program: parent to continue praising correct /f/ in everyday speech and to introduce a few consistent /s/ practice words (sun, sock) using the “snake sound” cues, focusing on short, positive practice rather than long drills."

Parent notices frequent “stopping” of /s/ and /f/ (e.g., “tun” for sun, “pish” for fish).\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned with brief hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance. Once in the room, engaged well in play-based tasks with cars and animal toys. Attention was variable; needed occasional redirection from self-directed play back to sound practice but responded to visual supports and short activities.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Initial /f/ at isolation and syllable level\n- Introduced /f/ using “quiet lip-bite, long air” cue with mirror. In isolation, child produced /f/ with moderate verbal and visual cues in approximately half of attempts; tended to substitute /p/ when cueing faded.\n- At CV syllable level (e.g., “fuh,” “fee,” “foh”), accuracy decreased; often reverted to /p/ or omitted the consonant. Able to imitate a few accurate CVs when model and gesture were closely paired.\n\n2) Initial /s/ in isolation and simple CV syllables\n- Practiced “snake sound” /s/ in isolation with visual cue (finger in front of mouth). Child could sustain /s/ briefly in some trials but frequently produced /t/ or stopped the airflow.\n- At CV level, productions were mostly /tV/ (e.g., “tee” for “see”). Needed maximal modeling and repetition. Occasional correct /s/ in isolation when attention was high.\n\n3) Simple CVC words with final /p, m, t/ for overall consonant production\n- During play, probed final consonants (e.g., “cup,” “map,” “hat”). Child omitted many final sounds, especially in spontaneous play. With direct imitation and tapping cue on table, produced some clearer final /p, m/ in single words.\n- Accuracy inconsistent; still at early stage of learning to mark final sounds.\n\n4) Early word combinations (2–3 word phrases) for functional communication\n- In play, child used a mix of single words and short phrases (“my turn,” “more car,” “no mine”). Many productions were reduced or unclear, but intent was generally understood with context.\n- Modeled clearer 2–3 word phrases and encouraged imitation. Child imitated several short phrases with support.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue targeting initial /f/ and /s/ at isolation and simple syllable level next session, focusing on establishing consistent airflow.\n- Encourage caregiver to model slow, clear /f/ and /s/ words during daily routines (e.g., “fish,” “sun,” “soap”) without pressuring child to repeat.\n- Plan to further probe final consonant production and monitor phrase length and intelligibility in play."

Able to produce a small set of CV syllables with emerging independence.\n\n2) Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced sustained /s/ as “quiet snake sound.” Child produced longer, more consistent /s/ in isolation with visual cue and verbal reminder to keep tongue behind teeth.\n- In CV syllables, still often defaulted to /tV/, but had a few more accurate /sV/ productions today, particularly with exaggerated model and slower pacing. Performance remains inconsistent but shows emerging improvement.\n\n3) CVC words with final /p, m, t/\n- Used picture cards and toys (e.g., “cup,” “map,” “cat”) to elicit final consonants in imitation. Child produced clearer final /p/ and /m/ in more trials compared to previous session when given a tapping or “stop sound” cue.\n- Final /t/ remained more challenging; often omitted or replaced with a vowel.

She noted that he often leaves off the ends of words (e.g., “ca” for “cat”). No recent changes in hearing, health, or routines.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- 4-year-old boy attended with his mother. Transitioned into the therapy room with mild hesitation but joined the activities after a brief warm-up game. Sat at the table for short periods, then preferred floor-based play. Responded well to visual supports and turn-taking games. Some silliness noted when tasks became more challenging; responded to redirection and praise.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CV → CVC words: /p, m, t/)\n- Targeted final consonants in simple picture naming (e.g., \"map,\" \"cap,\" \"mom,\" \"mat\").\n- In imitation, he was able to add a final sound in roughly half of opportunities; productions were often weak or omitted in spontaneous attempts (e.g., “ma” for “map”).\n- Benefited from direct models, tapping the table for the final sound, and verbal cueing (\"close your word\").\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and simple syllables (CV)\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation using a \"coughing\" and \"back sound\" cue. Accuracy was inconsistent; he often substituted /t/ (fronting).\n- In CV syllables (e.g., “ku,” “ki,” “ko”), he produced a few accurate attempts with maximal verbal and visual cues (open mouth, tongue back).\n- Required frequent reminders and slowed rate to achieve correct placement.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple CV syllables\n- Introduced /s/ as a \"quiet snake\" sound. In isolation, he could approximate /s/ with a prolonged airflow when watching the clinician’s mouth.\n- In CV syllables (e.g., “see,” “soo”), accuracy was low; he often produced /d/ or omitted the sound entirely.\n- Tolerated visual cues (mirror, clinician model) and some tactile cues (pointing to teeth and lips), but needed high support.\n\n4. Syllable structure: CV and CVCV\n- Observed spontaneous use of a variety of CV and reduplicated CVCV forms in play (e.g., “mama,” “baba,” “dodo”).\n- Longer words showed syllable reduction (e.g., “nana” for “banana”).\n- Used modeling and clapping to highlight all the \"beats\" in words.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to target final consonants in simple CVC words and initial /k/ and /s/ at isolation and CV levels.\n- Encourage parents to emphasize final sounds during daily routines (e.g., “cup—cuP,” “bed—beD”) with slow, clear models, without pressuring him to repeat every time.\n- Plan to gather additional baseline data next session and consider introducing simple word-level tasks if consistency improves."

Remained engaged with table-top games for slightly longer intervals than last session. Needed occasional movement breaks but returned to tasks with simple prompts. Enjoyed turn-taking and was motivated by stickers.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words (/p, m, t/)\n- Practiced final /p, m, t/ using picture cards and a simple board game. Compared to last session, he produced more consistent final sounds in imitation, particularly for /m/ and /p/ (e.g., \"map,\" \"mom\").\n- Still frequently omitted final consonants in spontaneous naming, but with cues such as \"say it again, close your word,\" he showed emerging attempts to add the ending.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CV and CVC syllables\n- Continued work on /k/ as a \"back sound\" using mirror, tongue-back cues, and \"cough\" trick.\n- Demonstrated more frequent accurate /k/ in CV syllables (e.g., \"koo,\" \"kah\") in imitation compared to baseline; substitutions to /t/ still common without cues.\n- Introduced a few simple CVC words (\"car,\" \"key\") at the imitated level. He approximated the /k/ in some trials but needed direct modeling and slowed rate.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation using a straw and snake visuals. He was able to hold a clearer /s/ for short durations in imitation when focusing on airflow and tongue position.\n- In CV syllables, he continued to show low accuracy, often producing /d/ or an indistinct sound. However, he attempted more repetitions per trial and was more willing to watch the clinician’s mouth.\n\n4. Syllable awareness for multisyllabic words\n- Used clapping and pacing boards for longer words (e.g., \"banana,\" \"butterfly\"). He participated and could match the number of \"claps\" with clinician support.\n- Production remained reduced (e.g., \"nana\" for \"banana\"), but he tolerated modeling and repetition well.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain current targets, as skills are just beginning to emerge. Continue intensive practice of final consonants and initial /k/ at syllable and simple word levels.\n- Encourage home practice with 5–10 CVC words, focusing on strong final sounds, using a \"tap\" on the table or child’s hand to mark the ending.\n- Consider adding simple carrier phrases (\"my ___\") with CVC words once final consonants become more consistent."

Initial /k/ in CVC words\n- Focused on initial /k/ in simple words (\"car,\" \"cup,\" \"key,\" \"cow\") in a play-based car game.\n- Accuracy at the imitated word level improved relative to last session; fewer substitutions to /t/ when given a verbal cue (\"tongue back\").\n- Still required moderate verbal and visual cueing, but there were several independent correct /k/ productions during play (e.g., spontaneous \"car\" while pushing the toy car).\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued practice of /s/ in isolation and with simple vowels. Accuracy in isolation improved; he could produce a clearer, longer \"snake\" sound in most imitated trials.\n- In CV syllables (\"see,\" \"soo\"), he produced more recognizable /s/ sounds, though consistency remained limited. Often needed a reminder to keep his tongue behind his teeth and to \"blow the air.\" \n\n4. Syllable structure / multisyllabic words\n- Practiced tapping and jumping for each syllable in target words (\"banana,\" \"dinosaur,\" \"butterfly\"). He participated enthusiastically.\n- Still reduced syllables in speech, but attempted more full-word repetitions after models.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue at the word level for final consonants and initial /k/, with a mix of imitation and cued independent productions. Not yet ready for phrase-level work consistently but may trial short carrier phrases for highly familiar CVC words.\n- Encourage caregivers to praise any attempts at final sounds and back sounds (\"I heard your /k/ in 'car'!\").\n- Provide a short home list of 6–8 CVC /p, m, t/ words and 3–4 initial /k/ words for daily practice, focusing on quality over quantity."

Final consonants in CVC words (/p, m, t/): imitation → cued independent\n- Worked on final consonants in a fishing game and picture naming.\n- At the imitated word level, he now produced final /p, m, t/ with good consistency across a set of familiar and some new words.\n- With minimal cues (visual tap, brief reminder), he was increasingly able to produce final consonants independently in structured tasks. Spontaneous productions during play remained less consistent but were more frequent than in previous sessions.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CVC words and early carrier phrases\n- Targeted initial /k/ words (\"car,\" \"cup,\" \"cat,\" \"cow\") in a car race game.\n- Accuracy for /k/ at the imitated word level improved; he produced a clear back sound in most trials with light verbal cueing.\n- Introduced simple carrier phrases (\"my car,\" \"my cup\") using picture supports.

Initial /s/ in CV and CVC words\n- Moved from isolated /s/ to simple CV and CVC words (\"see,\" \"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"soap\").\n- Accuracy in imitation was higher than in previous weeks, though he still sometimes substituted /d/ or produced a short, distorted sound.\n- Benefited from a mirror, \"teeth together\" cues, and prolonged airflow. Showed better success when he slowed down.\n\n4. Syllable structure: multisyllabic words\n- Practiced clapping and segmenting 3-syllable words (\"banana,\" \"dinosaur\").\n- He was able to match the number of syllables more consistently, though his spoken productions continued to drop a syllable at times.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Begin to systematically practice short carrier phrases with familiar CVC and initial /k/ words in therapy.\n- At home, parents can use simple frames (\"my ___,\" \"big ___\") with practiced words, modeling clearly and praising any attempt.\n- Continue to build consistency with /s/ at the word level in imitation before moving to phrases.\n- Monitor readiness for more independent phrase-level productions over the next few sessions."

Still needed reminders for tongue placement and airflow, but overall productions were clearer than in earlier sessions.\n- Occasional spontaneous attempts at /s/ words were heard in play (e.g., \"sock\"), though not yet consistent.\n\n4. Multisyllabic word production\n- Practiced 3-syllable words (\"banana,\" \"dinosaur,\" \"umbrella\") with clapping and pacing.\n- He showed slightly improved marking of all syllables when repeating after the clinician, but consonant clarity within the words remained variable.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue building phrase-level practice for CVC words and initial /k/ within structured tasks, gradually reducing models.\n- Maintain focus on initial /s/ at the word level; not yet ready for consistent phrase-level practice.\n- Home program: encourage 5–10 minutes daily of \"sound sentences\" using simple frames (\"my ___,\" \"I see ___\") with practiced CVC and /k/ words; emphasize slow rate and clear endings.\n- Plan to probe for more independent phrase productions next session."

Family notices that child often leaves off sounds at the ends of words (e.g., \"ca\" for \"cat\") and sometimes says \"t\" for \"k\". No major changes since initial evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned with some hesitation but separated from caregiver with brief reassurance. Once in the room, engaged well in play-based tasks and responded positively to visual toys and turn-taking games. Attention was variable; needed intermittent redirection from self-directed play back to speech tasks.\n\nGoals / observations:\n1. Final consonant production (p, t, m) at CVC word level in imitation\n- Target words included \"cap, cat, cup, mat, map, mop, mom\" in picture naming and play. Child was able to imitate final consonants inconsistently; many productions were reduced to CV forms (e.g., \"ca\" for \"cat\"). When cued to \"keep the sound on,\" could occasionally add a quiet final consonant. Accuracy estimated around 30–40% in imitation with moderate verbal and visual cueing (touching mouth, slowing rate).\n\n2. Initial /k/ at syllable and word level in imitation\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation and in simple syllables (\"kee, koo, kah\") using a \"back sound\" cue and tongue placement demonstration. Child frequently substituted /t/ for /k/ (\"tea\" for \"key\"). With simultaneous production and mirror support, child was able to achieve a few accurate /k/ sounds, though consistency was low. At word level (\"key, car, cow\"), most attempts remained fronted.\n\n3. Initial /f/ at syllable and word level in imitation\n- Introduced \"lip-bite\" cue for /f/ and used visual model with a puppet. Practiced \"fa, fee, foo\" and words such as \"fish, fun, feet.\" Child tended to substitute /p/ or omit the sound. With maximal verbal and gestural cues, achieved some approximations, but productions were often distorted or brief.\n\n4. CV and CVCV syllable shapes in play\n- During play, child produced many CV and CVCV (same consonant) shapes (e.g., \"mama, dada, bubu\"). Occasional CVC forms emerged spontaneously but were not consistent. No clear multisyllabic word targets today; focus was on establishing clear single syllables.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build awareness of final consonants and back sounds (/k/) in highly structured imitation tasks.\n- Encourage parent to model slow, clear CVC words in daily routines (e.g., \"cup, hot, bed\"), emphasizing the end sound without asking the child to repeat every time.\n- Next session: continue with final /p, t, m/ at word level and explore whether /k/ is easier in play versus drill; maintain focus on imitation level for now."

Family continues to notice dropped end sounds, but feels speech is \"a bit clearer\" this week. No concerns about hearing or health.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered the room readily and appeared comfortable with clinician. Demonstrated good engagement in turn-taking games and tolerated structured table-top tasks for short bursts. Needed brief movement breaks but returned to tasks with minimal prompting.\n\nGoals / observations:\n1. Final consonant production (p, t, m) in CVC words (imitation → supported spontaneous)\n- Practiced minimal pairs (e.g., \"ca\" vs. \"cat,\" \"bee\" vs. \"beep\") using pictures and a simple \"finished sound\" cue. Child showed noticeable improvement from last session: more frequent attempts to add final consonants and occasional self-corrections without prompting. Estimated accuracy ~60% in imitation, with several clear, independent productions during play (e.g., \"pop,\" \"mom\"). Still required verbal reminders to \"keep the last sound\" but needed fewer cues overall.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at syllable and word level in imitation\n- Continued with tongue-back cue and mirror. Child produced /k/ in isolation with moderate support and was able to maintain /k/ in CV syllables (\"koo, kah\") in about half of opportunities. At word level (\"key, car, cookie\"), fronting to /t/ persisted but there were more approximations that began with a back sound. Child tolerated multiple practice trials without frustration.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in CV and CVC words in imitation\n- Reintroduced \"bite your lip and blow\" cue with visual model. Child demonstrated clearer /f/ in syllables (\"fee, foo\") with hand-over-hand cue for lip placement initially, fading to verbal reminders. At the word level (\"fish, fun, food\"), accuracy was emerging; many productions were approximations but more clearly fricative than last week. Accuracy still low overall but effort and awareness improved.\n\n4. CVCV (alternating consonants) syllable shapes in play\n- During play-based activities, encouraged words like \"bunny, baby, cookie.\" Child produced several two-syllable words, though some syllables were reduced or simplified. Demonstrated increased willingness to attempt longer words, even when not fully accurate.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Given improved consistency with final consonants, continue CVC practice and begin incorporating final consonants into simple carrier phrases (e.g., \"my cat,\" \"big cup\") next week if accuracy remains stable.\n- Encourage caregivers to highlight final sounds in key words during routines (e.g., \"pop,\" \"hot,\" \"bed\"), praising any attempts.\n- Maintain focus on imitation for /k/ and /f/ while gradually fading cues as tolerated."

Occasional silliness but generally responsive to redirection and visual schedules.\n\nGoals / observations:\n1. Final consonant production (p, t, m, n) in CVC words and short phrases\n- Used picture cards and simple play routines (e.g., popping bubbles, feeding animals) to elicit CVC words (\"pop, cat, mat, man, pan\").

Some spontaneous carryover occurred in short phrases (\"my cat,\" \"big cup\") with light verbal reminders. Occasional omissions persisted, but there were more accurate, natural-sounding productions overall compared to prior sessions.\n\n2.

Child showed more consistent lip placement with less physical guidance needed. Accuracy in imitation was emerging (~50–60%), with some clear /f/ productions in high-interest contexts (e.g., blowing pretend candles). Substitutions to /p/ were less frequent but still present.\n\n4. Two- and three-word phrases with clear target sounds\n- Embedded target words with final consonants and /k/ into short phrases (\"my cat,\" \"big cake,\" \"more pop\"). Child imitated short phrases accurately when models were provided and occasionally produced them spontaneously in context. Intelligibility improved when target sounds were produced correctly.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen final consonant accuracy and begin to increase expectations for phrase-level productions when CVC accuracy is adequate.\n- Maintain /k/ and /f/ at word level; consider probing simple carrier phrases (\"I see ___\") for /k/ if accuracy continues to rise.\n- Home: caregivers to model and occasionally prompt phrases that include strong final consonants (e.g., \"big cup,\" \"red hat\"), giving specific praise for \"end sounds.\""

Still occasional omissions or neutralized finals, but overall clarity continues to improve.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word level and in simple carrier phrases (imitation)\n- Practiced /k/ words (\"key, car, cookie, cow, cake\") within a carrier phrase \"my ___\" and \"I see ___\". Child produced initial /k/ correctly in imitation in a majority of trials when given a brief reminder to \"use your back sound.\" Accuracy in phrases was slightly lower but still emerging. Fronting to /t/ occurred less frequently than in previous weeks.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in CV/CVC words and limited phrases (imitation)\n- Continued work with \"fish, fun, five, feet\" using visual and verbal cues. Child more reliably used lip-bite posture, though some productions remained weak or brief. Accuracy in imitation around 60–70% with moderate cueing. Attempted short phrases such as \"my fish\" and \"five fish\" with variable clarity.\n\n4. Two- and three-word phrases with target sounds in structured play\n- Embedded target words in short phrases during play (\"big cake,\" \"more pop,\" \"my car\"). Child imitated these phrases with relatively good accuracy when provided with clear models and moderate pacing cues. Some spontaneous phrases included target words with partial accuracy, indicating growing generalization.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue at current levels, focusing on stabilizing final consonants and /k/ in short phrases.\n- Maintain /f/ practice at word level and brief phrases, emphasizing strong, continuous airflow.\n- Home: encourage child to use short phrases with target words during routines (e.g., \"my cup,\" \"more cake\"), modeling and gently prompting as needed."

Final consonant production (p, t, m, n, k) in CVC words and short phrases\n- Continued practice with a variety of CVC words and simple phrases (\"big cup,\" \"red hat,\" \"my duck\"). Child maintained similar performance to last session, with generally consistent final consonant use in imitation and structured play. Spontaneous use of final consonants occurred more often in high-interest contexts, but not yet across all words. Skills appear stable at this level.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word and carrier phrase level (imitation; emerging spontaneous)\n- Targeted /k/ words in carrier phrases (\"my car,\" \"I see a cow,\" \"big cookie\"). Child produced initial /k/ accurately in imitation in many trials, with occasional fronting. In spontaneous play, child sometimes produced approximations that were closer to /k/ but still inconsistent.

Accuracy remained in the moderate range; child still needed verbal cues to sustain airflow and avoid stopping the sound.\n\n4. Two- and three-word phrases containing target sounds\n- Used structured play scenarios (feeding animals, driving cars) to elicit phrases with target words. Child imitated these phrases with generally good success when provided with clear models, but spontaneous phrase-level accuracy for target sounds remained variable.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to consolidate current gains with final consonants and /k/ and /f/ at word and short-phrase levels.\n- Consider introducing a few new CVC targets to support generalization while maintaining similar difficulty level.\n- Home: caregivers to continue emphasizing final sounds and back sounds in everyday words, praising attempts rather than correcting every error."

Establish /k/ in isolation\n- Practiced back sound /k/ with tongue-back cues and use of mirror. Child was able to approximate /k/ in isolation with simultaneous visual and verbal cueing in a few attempts but often substituted /t/ or produced a neutral vocalization.\n- Required maximal verbal models and tactile cues to jaw and throat. No consistent independent productions yet.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in simple CV syllables (e.g., \"ku, ka, ki\")\n- When attempting CV syllables, child continued to front to /t/ in most attempts (e.g., \"ta\" for \"ka\").\n- With slow modeling and hand cue for \"back sound,\" child produced a few approximations that were closer to /k/, but these were not yet reliable.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Targeted /f/ using \"biting lip and blowing\" cue. Child could imitate /f/ in isolation in some attempts when watching the clinician's mouth but often reduced it to /p/ or omitted the airflow.\n- In CV syllables (\"foo, fee\"), productions were mostly /p/ or /h/ plus vowel. Needed continuous visual modeling and repetition.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Observed in play: child produced a range of CV and reduplicated CVCV syllables (e.g., \"mama,\" \"baba\") spontaneously.\n- Less consistent with alternating CVCV (e.g., \"tiger\" approximated as \"tata\" or \"tiga\"). Did not directly target for drill this session but noted as baseline.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to establish consistent /k/ and /f/ in isolation and simple syllables with high levels of cueing.\n- Introduce brief, play-based practice at home: parent to model \"back sound\" /k/ in front of mirror during bath time (e.g., \"ku, ka\") and \"lip-bite\" /f/ during toothbrushing.\n- Next session: maintain focus on /k/ and /f/ at isolation and CV levels; consider using more tactile/visual supports and simple picture cards if attention allows."

This was an appropriate stretch level for the end of session and showed some promising attempts.\n\n3. /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Child demonstrated more reliable lip placement for /f/ with visual modeling. When cued to \"bite your lip and blow,\" child produced several clear /f/ sounds in isolation.\n- In CV syllables (\"fee, foo\"), child imitated with emerging accuracy; still occasional /p/ or /h/ substitutions, but more frequent true fricative productions compared to baseline.\n\n4. Early CVCV word shapes\n- Practiced a few simple CVCV words in play (e.g., \"bunny, baby\"). Child produced most syllables but often simplified consonants.\n- Focus today was observation rather than direct shaping; child showed willingness to repeat clinician’s models.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen /k/ and /f/ in isolation and CV syllables, and begin to build a small core set of /k/ initial words in imitation.\n- Encourage parent to practice 3–5 \"car\" words at home (e.g., car, key, cookie) with slow, clear models and praise any attempts at back sound.\n- Next session: increase practice trials for /k/ and /f/ in structured play; consider simple drill game for /k/ words if engagement remains strong."

Consonant was usually maintained in the practiced words.\n- Needed some pacing cues (slow rate, tapping for each word). Performance was slightly better when phrases were embedded in a game (e.g., parking the car and saying \"my car\").\n\n3. /f/ initial words (imitation)\n- Practiced a set of /f/ words (fish, four, fan, foot, fun). Child imitated with fair to good accuracy when watching clinician's mouth and using \"lip-bite and blow\" cue.\n- Some stopping to /p/ still occurred, especially at the beginning of a new word list; improved after a few warm-up trials.\n\n4. Early multisyllabic words with target sounds\n- Introduced a few simple multisyllabic words containing /k/ or /f/ (e.g., \"coffee,\" \"cookie,\" \"sofa\"). Child approximated these, often preserving one target sound but simplifying other syllables.\n- Focused on maintaining the correct consonant rather than full word accuracy.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on consolidating /k/ and /f/ at the imitated word level and gradually increase phrase-level practice for well-established words.\n- Home practice: encourage parent to embed target words into short phrases during daily routines (\"big car,\" \"my fish\"), accepting close approximations and praising clear attempts.\n- Next session: continue phrase practice and monitor for additional spontaneous productions of /k/ and /f/ words in play."

Child produced these with generally good accuracy in imitation, often requiring only an initial cue and then maintaining correct placement across several trials.\n- During play, child spontaneously used \"car\" and \"cookie\" with consistent /k/ in many instances; still occasional fronting with less familiar /k/ words.\n\n2. /k/ in slightly longer phrases/sentences (imitated; 3–4 words)\n- Trialed short sentences such as \"I see car\" and \"push my car\". Child imitated with mixed accuracy; often preserved the /k/ but reduced other parts of the phrase.\n- Needed pacing and modeling, but this level is emerging and appropriate.\n\n3. /f/ initial words (imitated) and emerging phrase level\n- Revisited /f/ words (fish, four, fan, foot, five). Child showed slightly more consistent fricative production compared to previous session, especially after a brief warm-up.\n- Introduced simple phrases (\"my fish,\" \"big foot\") in imitation. Child often maintained /f/ when the word was familiar but dropped to /p/ when attention waned.\n\n4. Syllable structure and intelligibility in play\n- In free play, child used a mix of 2–4 word utterances. Consonant simplifications and omissions were still present, but some target words (especially /k/ words) were clearer.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen /k/ and /f/ at word and short phrase levels; maintain focus on consistency across different activities.\n- Home practice: encourage brief daily practice of 3–4 familiar /k/ and /f/ words in short phrases, keeping it playful and low-pressure.\n- Next session: similar targets to consolidate gains; consider adding a few new /k/ or /f/ words if current set remains strong."

Familiar listeners continue to understand most of what child says, but clarity for strangers is variable.\n- Parent continues to practice target words and short phrases at home, though some days child is less interested.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated from caregiver easily and engaged quickly in play.\n- Participation was generally good; required occasional breaks and changes in activity when tasks became more repetitive.\n\nGoals/activities:\n1. /k/ initial words and phrases (imitation and spontaneous use in play)\n- Child maintained similar performance to previous session. Accurate /k/ productions were consistent for a core set of practiced words in imitation.\n- In play, child spontaneously used several /k/ words (\"car,\" \"cookie,\" \"key\") with mostly correct back sound. Occasional fronting persisted, especially with less familiar words or when speaking quickly.\n\n2. /k/ in short sentences (imitated)\n- Practiced 3–4 word sentences (\"I want car,\" \"push my car\"), using picture scenes.\n- Child was able to imitate with fair accuracy; the /k/ was generally present, while other parts of the sentence were sometimes simplified. Performance comparable to last week.\n\n3. /f/ initial words and short phrases (imitation)\n- Child produced /f/ words (fish, four, fan, foot) with similar accuracy to previous session. Needed initial visual cueing and then could maintain several accurate productions.\n- In short phrases (\"my fish,\" \"four feet\"), fricative was sometimes maintained, sometimes stopped to /p/. No notable change compared to last week.\n\n4. Overall speech in play\n- Child used 2–4 word utterances spontaneously. Intelligibility to clinician remained moderate; familiar /k/ and some /f/ words were clearer, but other consonants and syllable structures continued to impact overall clarity.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue at current level for /k/ and /f/ to consolidate skills; no major shift in hierarchy this week.\n- Home practice: maintain short, frequent practice sessions, focusing on a small number of words/phrases that child can say well to build confidence.\n- Next session: repeat similar targets, with possible introduction of one or two new /k/ or /f/ words if engagement is high, while monitoring consistency."
