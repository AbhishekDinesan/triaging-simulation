She notices he leaves off “end sounds” in words (e.g., “ca” for “cat”). No major changes since initial visit.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with minimal hesitation, holding mom’s hand. Once seated, he engaged well with preferred toys (cars, farm animals). Attention to structured tasks was fair; he worked in short bursts of 3–4 minutes with frequent play breaks.\n\nGoals and therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Targeted simple CVC words in imitation (e.g., “cup, cap, cat, map, mop, mat”).\n- Child often omitted final consonants or produced a prolonged vowel (e.g., “cu” for “cup”).\n- With maximal verbal cueing (“use your quiet ending sound”), visual cues (pointing to mouth), and segmentation (cu—p), he produced a few accurate final consonants, but these were inconsistent and not yet self-initiated.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and syllables\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation using “back sound” cues and mirror.\n- Child could approximate the /k/ sound in isolation with simultaneous models and tongue-back cue but frequently substituted /t/ when attempting at the syllable level (e.g., “kuh” → “tuh”).\n- Accuracy best in simultaneous production; reduced accuracy when imitating after a delay.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in isolation\n- Introduced “lip-bite, quiet air” cue for /f/.\n- Child was interested in watching the SLP’s mouth and attempted /f/ in isolation several times.\n- Productions were mostly approximations (/h/ or /p/ substitutions). Occasional clear /f/ occurred with hand-on-chin tactile cue and slowed rate, but not yet consistent.\n\n4. Functional word attempts in play\n- Encouraged use of single words to request (e.g., “more, go, up, open”).\n- Child preferred pointing/gesturing and often used single-word approximations that were difficult to understand.\n- With direct models and immediate imitation, he was able to repeat a small set of functional words (e.g., “go, up, in”) with variable clarity.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue targeting final consonants at the imitated word level with high support.\n- Maintain focus on establishing more consistent /k/ and /f/ in isolation before expanding.\n- Home practice: caregiver to model and emphasize “end sounds” in simple words (e.g., cat, cup, map) during daily routines, praising any attempts at full words rather than correcting heavily.\n- Next session: re-check final consonants and initial /k/; consider adding simple CV and CVC syllable drills if attention allows."

He was generally cooperative, though he needed gentle redirection when he became silly (giggling and making sound effects instead of target sounds). Able to attend to adult-directed tasks for slightly longer stretches today.\n\nGoals and therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Revisited same CVC targets in imitation (e.g., “cup, cap, cat, map, mat, mop”).\n- Compared to last week, child showed emerging accuracy: more frequent attempts to close the word with a consonant, though often distorted or substituted (e.g., “cub” for “cup”).\n- With segmented modeling (e.g., “cu—P”) and moderate verbal cueing, he produced clearer final consonants on several trials. Accuracy is still inconsistent but there were more recognizable final consonants than at the previous session.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued “back sound” practice with mirror and tactile cue to the throat.\n- Child produced /k/ in isolation with improved consistency when imitating the SLP’s model.\n- Began trialing simple CV syllables (e.g., “ka, koo”). Many productions remained /t/-like, but there were a few clearer /k/ syllables when given slow modeling and repetition. Still relies on imitation and visual cues.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Used “bite your lip, blow” cue with visual demonstration.\n- Child showed more frequent attempts at /f/ today and appeared to enjoy blowing air.\n- A small number of productions were clearly /f/, especially in isolation. When paired with a vowel (e.g., “foo, fah”), accuracy decreased and /h/ substitutions reappeared. Continued need for direct modeling and reminders.\n\n4. Functional requesting words in play\n- Practiced imitating functional words in play (e.g., “go, up, open, more”) to operate toys.\n- Child imitated a few words with slightly clearer articulation than last session and occasionally attempted them spontaneously (e.g., “go” while pushing the car).\n- Speech remained difficult to understand without context, but there were more attempts to use words instead of gestures alone.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue at current hierarchy level; skills are beginning to emerge but not yet consistent.\n- Maintain emphasis on CVC final consonants and initial /k/ and /f/ in structured imitation.\n- Home practice: caregiver to play simple “go/stop” games, encouraging child to say “go” and praising any attempts; continue to gently emphasize end sounds.\n- Next session: consider adding a few new CVC words for variety while staying at the same level."

She feels she can understand him slightly better when he is calm and speaking slowly.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered the room independently and appeared comfortable with the routine. Good participation in turn-taking games. Attention was improved; he was able to remain in adult-directed tasks for 5–6 minutes with brief play breaks.\n\nGoals and therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Targeted a mix of familiar and new CVC words (e.g., “cup, cat, map, mat, hat, hot”) at the imitated word level.\n- Notable improvement in consistency: with moderate verbal and visual cues, child frequently marked the final consonant, though some were still imprecise.\n- Began to reduce cueing on familiar items; on a small set of practiced words, he sometimes produced the final consonant after just a model without segmentation.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CV and CVC syllables\n- Continued work on /k/ using mirror and “tongue back” cue.\n- Child produced /k/ in isolation with relatively good reliability during this session.\n- Transitioned to CV syllables and a few simple CVC words (e.g., “key, car, cow”). There was moderate progress; he produced clearer /k/ on several imitated words, though he still frequently substituted /t/ without cues.\n- Required verbal reminders (“back sound”) and slow rate to maintain accuracy.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in isolation and simple words\n- Practiced /f/ in isolation, CV syllables, and a small set of simple words (e.g., “fun, feet”).\n- Child showed emerging ability to produce a recognizable /f/ at the beginning of words when given a clear model and visual cue.\n- He occasionally reverted to /p/ or /h/, but the number of accurate productions increased relative to previous session.\n\n4. Functional words and short phrases\n- Encouraged child to use words to request and comment (e.g., “more car,” “my turn”).\n- Child imitated several 2-word combinations with varying clarity; consonants were often reduced but vowels helped make his intentions clearer.\n- No independent phrase-level speech yet in the therapy room, but he was more willing to attempt imitations.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to build consistency at the imitated CVC level for final consonants; consider trialing simple carrier phrases (e.g., “I see __”) for easier words if accuracy remains stable.\n- Maintain work on initial /k/ and /f/ in words; may start to probe these sounds in short, highly familiar phrases later in the block.\n- Home practice: caregiver to use picture cards or objects for 3–4 target words (e.g., “cat, cup, map”) and encourage slow, clear repetition, praising any attempts at end sounds.\n- Next session: re-assess readiness for short phrases using high-probability CVC words."

She notices he sometimes corrects himself when she repeats a word back with the end sound.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned smoothly and eagerly chose a board game. He demonstrated good turn-taking and responded well to praise. Attention and participation were strong; he tolerated slightly longer structured tasks without needing as many breaks.\n\nGoals and therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m, n/)\n- Continued practice of familiar CVC words and introduced a few new ones (e.g., “pan, man, ten”).\n- Accuracy at the imitated word level improved; child often produced the final consonant with only a simple verbal model and light visual cue.\n- For a core set of words (e.g., “cup, cat, map”), he produced the final consonant more independently, sometimes without explicit prompting during play.\n- Trialed short carrier phrases (e.g., “I see cat,” “my cup”) with these high-probability words. In phrases, he occasionally dropped the final consonant, but there were several successful productions when cued to “keep the end sound.”\n\n2. Initial /k/ in words and short phrases\n- Practiced /k/ in initial position in a set of words (e.g., “key, car, cow, coat”).\n- Child demonstrated more consistent /k/ productions in imitation, needing fewer reminders to move his tongue back.\n- Briefly trialed simple phrases (e.g., “my car, go car”) using picture support. At phrase level, accuracy decreased but he attempted the /k/ in many trials and responded to verbal reminders.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in words\n- Continued work on /f/ with picture cards (“fish, fan, foot, fun”).\n- Child showed moderate progress: clearer /f/ productions were heard more frequently at the word level with a model.\n- He still required visual cueing (lip-bite gesture) but needed less repetition than in previous sessions.\n\n4. Functional 2-word combinations\n- Targeted functional phrases such as “more please,” “my turn,” “go car.”\n- Child imitated several of these with variable clarity; consonants were sometimes omitted, but his willingness to attempt longer utterances increased.\n- Some spontaneous single words were noted during play (e.g., “mine,” “up”).\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Given the moderate, meaningful gains in final consonant production, continue to build consistency at the word level and gradually increase phrase practice for the easiest words.\n- Maintain focus on initial /k/ and /f/ at the imitated word level, with occasional phrase probes.\n- Home practice: encourage simple phrases using practiced CVC words (e.g., “my cat,” “big cup”) while modeling clear end sounds; keep practice playful and brief.\n- Next session: monitor carryover of final consonants in short phrases; adjust hierarchy depending on stability."

He was cooperative overall, though needed occasional reminders to sit upright and face the pictures. Mild silliness at times but easily redirected.\n\nGoals and therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words; phrase level probes)\n- Practiced familiar CVC words (e.g., “cup, cat, map, man, pan, hat”).\n- Accuracy at the imitated word level remained generally good with light verbal cues. Child continued to demonstrate clearer final consonants on these familiar targets.\n- Phrases such as “my cat,” “big cup,” and “see pan” were probed again.

Recommend continued focus on consolidating final consonants and initial /k/ and /f/ in both single words and short phrases before further increasing complexity.\n- Home practice: continue modeling clear end sounds and target consonants within short, functional phrases (e.g., “my cat,” “big fish,” “see car”) during daily routines.\n- Next steps: if continuing in a new block, consider periodic probes of additional sounds or positions while maintaining core targets to support generalization."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\n- Caregiver (mom) shared that she is mostly concerned about others not understanding child's speech, especially with longer words and when talking fast. No major changes reported since initial evaluation. Child starting to ask more questions at home and is very talkative.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned with some hesitation but joined the session with encouragement. Once in the room, she was curious and talkative. Attention to structured tasks was fair; she preferred play-based activities and needed occasional redirection from toys back to speech targets.\n\nGoals / session targets:\n1. Initial /s/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation using \"snake sound\" cues and mirror. Able to hold /s/ briefly with clinician model, but productions were often too short or turned into /t/ or /sh/.\n- At the CV syllable level (e.g., \"see, soo, sah\"), she imitated several approximations, but accuracy was inconsistent and required frequent verbal and visual cues.\n- At simple word level (e.g., \"sun, soup, sock\"), she was often substituting /t/ or /sh/ and needed maximal modeling and reminders to keep tongue behind teeth.\n\n2. Final /t/ at word level (imitation)\n- Target words included \"hat, cat, boat, feet.\" She often omitted the final sound or added a vowel (e.g., \"ha\" for \"hat,\" \"fee\" for \"feet\").\n- With simultaneous production and hand-tapping cues for the final sound, she was able to mark /t/ in some words, but consistency was low.\n\n3. Initial /k/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- Child tended to front /k/ to /t/ (e.g., \"tar\" for \"car\"). Practiced tongue-back placement using a \"cough\" and \"back sound\" trick.\n- In isolation, a few clear /k/ productions emerged with maximal tactile/visual cues.\n- At word level (\"car, key, cow\"), productions were mostly /t/; accurate productions occurred only with heavy support.\n\n4. Functional communication observation\n- During play, child used many 2–4 word phrases (e.g., \"my turn,\" \"I want that,\" \"go fast\") but speech clarity reduced in longer phrases. Intelligibility with familiar listener (clinician) was fair; needed repetition requests.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to focus on establishing consistent productions of /s/, /t/, and /k/ in isolation and simple syllables before moving up the hierarchy.\n- Home practice: caregiver encouraged to model slow, clear \"snake sound\" /s/ during play and to emphasize final sounds in everyday words (e.g., \"hat,\" \"cat\") using a light tap gesture on the table or child’s hand. Keep practice playful and brief (1–2 minutes, a few times per day)."

No major changes in overall clarity, but mom notices child \"trying harder\" with certain words like \"sun\" and \"soap.\"\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated easily from caregiver and appeared excited to show \"snake sound.\" Engagement was good, with better tolerance for short structured tasks between play. Some silliness noted when tasks were more challenging, but she responded to gentle redirection.\n\nGoals / session targets:\n1. Initial /s/ in isolation, syllables, and words (imitation)\n- Marked improvement in ability to sustain /s/ in isolation with visual cue (finger in front of mouth) and mirror. She could hold a clear /s/ for several seconds in multiple trials.\n- At CV syllable level (\"see, soo, sah, say\"), productions were more consistent; occasional distortions but clearer airflow and less backing to /sh/.\n- At word level (\"sun, soup, sock, soap\"), she achieved multiple accurate imitations with verbal reminders to \"keep tongue behind teeth.\" Still required models but needed fewer repetitions to achieve a correct production.\n\n2. Final /t/ at word level (imitation)\n- Continued with \"hat, cat, boat, feet\" plus a few new words. She more consistently marked the final /t/ with simultaneous production and a tapping cue.\n- Some spontaneous approximations (e.g., saying \"hat\" with a clear final sound during a game) were observed, although still inconsistent.\n\n3. Initial /k/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- Used \"cough\" trick and tongue-back placement. Child produced more recognizable /k/ in isolation than last session.\n- At CV level (\"kee, koo, kah\"), she produced a mix of /k/ and /t/ but had more frequent correct trials compared to previous visit.\n- At word level (\"car, key, cow\"), she needed continued maximum verbal/visual cues; still tends to front to /t/, but a few clearer /k/ productions emerged with slow modeling.\n\n4. Functional carryover\n- In play, child attempted to use /s/ words from practice (e.g., \"sun,\" \"sock\") after clinician models. Intelligibility was slightly improved when she slowed down and used practiced words.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue at word level for initial /s/ and final /t/, with gradual introduction of short carrier phrases for most successful /s/ words in upcoming sessions if consistency continues.\n- Maintain focus on establishing /k/ with more consistent accuracy in isolation and syllables before advancing.\n- Home practice: encourage short /s/ and /t/ word games (e.g., naming pictures, simple matching). Caregiver to continue modeling slow speech and praising \"clear sounds.\""

Family still finds her hard to understand in longer sentences.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered room independently and quickly engaged with toys. She accepted turn-taking and structured activities well today, with fewer avoidance behaviors. Needed occasional breaks but came back to tasks with minimal prompting.\n\nGoals / session targets:\n1. Initial /s/ at word and simple phrase level (imitation with emerging independence)\n- Reviewed /s/ in isolation; accuracy remained strong with minimal verbal cueing.\n- At word level (\"sun, soup, sock, soap, seat\"), child produced more consistent accurate /s/ when imitating. Needed reminders less frequently.\n- Introduced simple carrier phrases (\"my ___,\" \"a ___\") with target words (e.g., \"my sock,\" \"a sun\"). She was able to imitate short phrases with generally clear /s/ in initial position, though accuracy dropped slightly compared to single words.\n\n2. Final /t/ at word level and in short phrases (imitation)\n- Practiced \"hat, cat, boat, feet, coat\" at the imitated word level. Child was more reliable in marking the final /t/, especially when the clinician used a quiet \"stop\" hand cue.\n- Trialed short phrases (\"my hat,\" \"big cat\"). She was able to approximate the final sound but sometimes reduced it or changed it to a softer sound.\n\n3. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)\n- Continued focus on tongue-back placement and \"cough\" strategy. Child produced multiple clear /k/ sounds in isolation with verbal and visual support.\n- At CV level (\"kee, koo, kah\"), she showed increased accuracy compared to previous sessions, though she still occasionally reverted to /t/.\n- Did not yet move consistently to word level for /k/ due to variable accuracy.\n\n4. Functional communication / intelligibility\n- During play, child used many 3–4 word phrases (e.g., \"I want more bubbles,\" \"put it in there\"). Intelligibility improved slightly when she slowed down and when words with practiced sounds were used.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on initial /s/ at word and short phrase level; continue to build consistency before moving to spontaneous use.\n- Continue final /t/ in words and phrases, aiming for more independent productions with reduced cues.\n- Keep /k/ at isolation and CV levels until accuracy is more stable, then gradually introduce simple words again.\n- Home practice: caregivers to practice a small set of /s/ and /t/ words in short, fun phrases (e.g., \"my sock,\" \"big cat\"), emphasizing slow, clear speech without pressuring for perfection."

Still difficulty with words like \"car\" and \"key.\"\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child arrived in good spirits and eagerly showed clinician her \"sock\" to say the word. Attention to structured tasks was improved; she tolerated slightly longer drill-like practice when paired with a game. Minimal redirection needed.\n\nGoals / session targets:\n1. Initial /s/ at word and short phrase level (imitation and emerging spontaneous use)\n- Child produced initial /s/ in a set of familiar words (\"sun, sock, soap, seat, soup\") with good consistency during imitation. Only occasional reminders for tongue placement were needed.\n- In short carrier phrases (\"my sock,\" \"a sun,\" \"soap here\"), she imitated phrases with relatively stable /s/ accuracy.\n- Spontaneous attempts noted during play, such as labeling \"sun\" and \"sock\" without a direct prompt. Some of these spontaneous productions maintained the clear /s/.\n\n2. Final /t/ in words and phrases (imitation with reduced cueing)\n- Practiced \"hat, cat, boat, feet, coat\" again and introduced \"out\" and \"hot.\" She continued to mark final /t/ more consistently than previous sessions.\n- Gesture cueing was faded in some trials; she could still produce a recognizable final consonant, although not always as a strong /t/.\n- Phrases such as \"my hat\" and \"get out\" were imitated with mixed but improving accuracy.\n\n3. Initial /k/ at CV and word level (imitation)\n- Child continued to show improved control of /k/ in CV syllables (\"kee, koo, kah\").\n- Re-introduced word-level targets (\"car, key, cow, cookie\"). She required clear models and verbal reminders to \"use the back sound.\" Accuracy was variable but higher than at baseline; a few correct productions per word were noted with multiple attempts.\n\n4. Early generalization\n- During play, child sometimes used practiced /s/ words in simple comments (\"my sock,\" \"sun up\"). Intelligibility for these specific words and phrases was noticeably better than for non-practiced words.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Begin to increase opportunities for semi-spontaneous /s/ use in structured play (e.g., having child request or label items with /s/ words) while maintaining practice at phrase level.\n- Continue building final /t/ in more functional phrases and short sentences as tolerated.\n- Keep working on /k/ at word level with a small, consistent set of target words to support consolidation.\n- Home practice: encourage child to use target /s/ and /t/ words during daily routines (e.g., getting \"sock,\" sitting in \"seat\"), with caregiver modeling and praising clear productions."

She appreciates the clearer /s/ and some final /t/ sounds, and hopes to see more change with /k/ over time.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned easily and was cooperative throughout the session. She showed good effort with sound practice and accepted feedback well. No significant behavior concerns.\n\nGoals / session targets:\n1. Initial /s/ in sentences and structured conversation\n- Ongoing sentence-level practice with /s/ (\"I see the sun,\" \"The sock is wet,\" \"I sit in the seat,\" \"I sip soup\"). Accuracy remained steady, with clear /s/ in most imitated sentences.\n- In brief conversational exchanges, she continued to use /s/ words such as \"sun,\" \"sock,\" and \"seat\" with similar clarity to prior sessions.\n\n2. Final /t/ in sentences and short narratives\n- Practiced final /t/ in words and sentences (\"hat,\" \"cat,\" \"feet,\" \"boat,\" \"Put on hat,\" \"I see a cat,\" \"He got in the boat\").\n- Child’s performance remained stable: she typically marked final /t/ during structured practice but still had variable accuracy in more spontaneous utterances.\n\n3. Initial /k/ in words and simple sentences\n- Continued with target /k/ words and sentences (\"car, key, cow, cookie, coat\"; \"I see a car,\" \"Big cookie\").\n- Accuracy and cueing needs were comparable to recent weeks. She showed ongoing awareness and occasional self-correction, but productions were not yet consistently accurate without support.\n\n4. Functional communication / summary of block\n- Child consistently uses multi-word utterances and is highly communicative. Intelligibility has improved for specific practiced words and short sentences, particularly those with /s/ and some final /t/ sounds. General conversational clarity remains an ongoing area of need, especially for less familiar words and when speaking quickly.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue therapy focusing on consolidation and generalization of /s/ and final /t/ at sentence and conversational levels.\n- Maintain targeted practice for /k/, with consideration of adding new motivating /k/ words as accuracy allows.\n- Home practice: caregivers encouraged to keep daily, brief practice with familiar /s/, /t/, and /k/ words and sentences, emphasizing slow rate, clear models, and positive feedback. Consider sharing a short list of \"best words\" for each sound to focus on between sessions."

            "note_text": "Parent/caregiver report:\n- Parent shared that child is “hard to understand” for unfamiliar listeners and often leaves off sounds at the ends of words (e.g., “ca” for “cat”). No previous speech therapy. Parent reports child is excited about starting “speech games.”\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated from parent with some hesitation but transitioned with visual schedule and toys.\n- Engaged best with turn-taking games and pretend play. Attention fluctuated; needed frequent redirection from preferred toys back to speech tasks.\n- Imitation skills emerging; child attempted to copy clinician’s models but often giggled or whispered productions.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. Initial /p, b, m/ in CV and CVC syllables (imitation)\n- Targeted simple syllables (e.g., “pa, ba, me, bee, pop, mom”) using picture cards and mirror.\n- Child imitated CV syllables with these early sounds with high success when given a direct model and visual cue (lip closure). CVC words were less consistent; final consonants frequently omitted (e.g., “po” for “pop”).\n- Benefited from slowed rate and simultaneous productions with clinician.\n\n2. Final consonant production in CVC words (p, m, t)\n- Practiced words like “cup, cap, cat, map, mop, mat” at the imitated word level.\n- Child attempted final consonants in about half of opportunities; many productions were approximations (e.g., “cu_,” “ma_”). Stopping the word and then adding the “tail sound” helped the child notice the final sound, though carryover to full words was limited.\n\n3. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Child showed fronting of /k/ to /t/ in spontaneous play (e.g., “tar” for “car”).\n- Introduced /k/ in isolation using “tongue up and back” cues and mirror. Child was able to produce a backed sound with maximal verbal and visual support in some trials.\n- CV syllables (e.g., “koo, kah”) were attempted but often reverted to /t/; this will remain a primary target.\n\n4. Establishing CV and CVC syllable shapes\n- Observed spontaneous use of V, CV, and some CVCV (same) patterns in play (e.g., “mama, dada, baby”).\n- When cued, child could imitate a variety of CV and CVCV (same) structures; CVC forms were much more difficult, particularly with final consonant closure.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to target early developing sounds (/p, b, m/) in CV and CVC forms, with emphasis on marking final consonants.\n- Continue intensive work on /k/ in isolation and CV syllables with visual supports and mirror.\n- Provide parent with a short list of CVC words using /p, m, t/ to practice “tail sounds” at home during play (e.g., “map, mop, cat, cap”).\n- Next session: re-check final consonant production and /k/ isolation; consider adding simple two-word combinations if attention allows."

Parent has been practicing “tail sounds” on a few words during book reading.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned into therapy room more easily today and quickly joined a familiar game from last session.\n- Attention to adult-directed tasks slightly improved; still required gentle reminders to stay with the activity but less resistance overall.\n- Imitation was more willing; child laughed less and seemed more comfortable making “big” sounds in front of the mirror.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. Initial /p, b, m/ in CVC words (imitation → emerging spontaneous)\n- Practiced with picture cards and a fishing game (e.g., “pop, map, bib, mop, mom”).\n- Child produced initial consonants accurately in the majority of trials with a model. Final consonant closure remained variable but showed more consistent attempts.\n- Notably, child spontaneously used clear CVC words “pop” and “mom” during play without direct prompting, suggesting early carryover for these specific items.\n\n2. Final consonants /p, m, t/ in CVC words\n- Used a “quiet tail sound” visual cue (pointing to the end of the word) and minimal pairs (e.g., “ma” vs “map”).\n- Child demonstrated more frequent attempts to add the final sound after initial production, especially when clinician paused and cued, “What’s the tail?”\n- Accuracy remained inconsistent but there was emerging awareness; child sometimes self-corrected when the clinician looked expectantly at the picture.\n\n3. /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued to show fronting to /t/ in conversation.\n- With maximal verbal, visual, and tactile cues (spoon under chin, mirror), child produced a backed /k/ sound in isolation in several trials. Accuracy was higher when starting from a prolonged vowel (“ah…k”).\n- CV syllables were attempted; a few approximations of “koo” and “kah” were noted but often drifted back to /t/.\n\n4. Simple two-word combinations with target CVC words\n- Briefly introduced two-word combinations such as “pop it,” “my map,” “big cup” at the imitated phrase level.\n- Child could imitate some two-word phrases, though the second word was often less clear. Emphasis remained on clarity of the CVC target.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue reinforcing final consonants using the “tail sound” strategy and visual cues; keep practice mostly at the word level.\n- Maintain intensive /k/ work in isolation and CV syllables; continue to use mirrors and tactile cues.\n- Encourage parent to highlight final sounds in a playful way at home (e.g., pausing and pointing to mouth when saying “cup,” “map”).\n- Next session: re-evaluate /k/ accuracy; if stability continues with /p, b, m/ CVCs, consider expanding phrase-level work for a small set of words."

Final consonants /p, m, t/ at imitated word level\n- Focused on CVC words in a board game format (e.g., “cup, cap, cat, map, mop, mat”).\n- Child marked final consonants more consistently than in previous sessions, with clearer closure on /p/ and /m/ in particular.\n- Required moderate verbal cues (“close it at the end,” “tail sound”) but began to anticipate the need for the final sound, sometimes adding it without direct prompting.\n\n2. Initial /p, b, m/ in CVC words (spontaneous use in structured play)\n- During play, child produced several CVC words (e.g., “pop, mom, baby, mop”) without immediate modeling.\n- Accuracy of initial consonants was high; final consonant accuracy in these spontaneous productions was variable but present more often than not.\n- This suggests growing stability of these early consonants at the word level.\n\n3. /k/ in isolation and CV syllables → trial of word level\n- Continued use of mirror and “tongue back” cues.\n- Child produced /k/ in isolation with improved consistency when given a vowel lead-in (“ee…k,” “ah…k”).\n- Trialed simple /k/ initial words (“car, key, cow”) at the imitated word level. Productions were often approximations (e.g., “tar” for “car”), but a few clearer /k/ productions were achieved with maximal cueing and slowed rate.\n\n4. Two-word phrases with high-probability CVC words\n- Practiced short phrases such as “my cup,” “big map,” “pop bubble” using a model and gesture.\n- Child imitated several two-word phrases with fair clarity on the target CVC word. The second word was sometimes reduced or less precise, which is expected at this stage.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on final consonants, as progress is emerging; continue using consistent visual and verbal cues.\n- Continue intensive work on /k/ in isolation and simple words; limit set of /k/ words to a few functional items (e.g., car, key, cow) for repetition.\n- Encourage parent to use simple two-word combinations with target words at home (e.g., “my cup,” “big cat”) and to praise any attempts at final sounds.\n- Next session: if consistency with final /p, m, t/ continues, consider slightly expanding final consonant set or increasing phrase-level practice."

Parent noted child sometimes emphasizes the last sound when reminded, saying it “extra big.”\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered happily and requested specific toys verbally.\n- Maintained engagement in therapist-led activities for most of the session, needing only brief breaks.\n- Demonstrated good turn-taking and responded well to specific feedback about “strong sounds.”\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. Final consonants /p, m, t/ at word and carrier-phrase levels\n- Used picture cards and a simple “I see ___” sentence strip.\n- At the imitated word level, child produced final /p, m, t/ with much improved consistency, often achieving clear closure without additional prompts.\n- When moved into the carrier phrase (e.g., “I see cup,” “I see cat”), child maintained reasonably good accuracy on the target word, though final consonants occasionally dropped when attention shifted to the whole phrase.\n\n2. Expansion of final consonants to /k/ and /n/\n- Introduced a small set of new CVC targets (e.g., “book, back, can, man”).\n- Child attempted these new patterns; final /k/ and /n/ were present in some imitated productions but less stable than /p, m, t/.\n- Required more explicit segmentation (e.g., “ba…ck,” “ma…n”) and visual support, but showed readiness to work at this expanded level.\n\n3. Initial /k/ in words and short phrases\n- Practiced initial /k/ with a limited set of functional words (e.g., “car, key, cow, cookie”).\n- With visual/tactile cues and slowed rate, child produced a recognizable /k/ at the beginning of these words more frequently than last week.\n- Trialed short imitated phrases (e.g., “go car,” “my key”). /k/ sometimes reverted to /t/ in phrases, but there were several clear productions indicating a meaningful step forward.\n\n4. Two- and three-word phrases with target CVC words\n- Used a play-based routine (feeding animals, parking cars) to elicit phrases such as “my cup,” “big cat,” “more map please.”\n- Child imitated these phrases with growing consistency and occasionally generated simple spontaneous phrases (e.g., “my car,” “more pop”). Target CVC words were usually the clearest element.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue practicing final /p, m, t/ in both single words and short carrier phrases to solidify accuracy.\n- Keep working on initial /k/ in a small set of familiar words, with gradual introduction into two-word phrases as tolerated.\n- Parent encouraged to model and gently highlight final sounds in short phrases at home (e.g., “big cat,” “hot cup”) and to praise attempts rather than perfection.\n- Next session: monitor stability of phrase-level final consonants and, if maintained, slowly increase variety of words and contexts."

Final /k/ in CVC words\n- Focused on “back, book, pack, duck, sock” in a matching and sorting activity.\n- Child produced clear final /k/ in some trials but continued to omit or alter it in others; accuracy appeared similar to last week.\n- Benefited from segmenting and from the clinician drawing attention to the “end sound.”\n\n4. Spontaneous phrase use with target words\n- During structured play, child generated various 2–3 word utterances including target words (e.g., “my book,” “big car,” “more cookie”).\n- Intelligibility to clinician was comparable to prior sessions, with target words generally clearer than connecting words.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue with current goals to allow more time for consolidation, especially for /k/ in final position and in connected speech.\n- Parent encouraged to keep modeling slow, clear phrases and to provide gentle reminders about “end sounds” and “back sound /k/” in natural contexts.\n- Next session: maintain similar targets but consider incorporating more play-based conversation to monitor carryover."

Reported that child is \"hard to understand\" for unfamiliar listeners and often leaves off sounds at the ends of words. No recent changes in health or hearing.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with brief hesitation but joined activities with support. Engaged best with play-based tasks involving cars and animals. Attention span was variable; needed several redirections back to speech tasks but remained generally cooperative.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Baseline for overall speech sound production\n- Obtained an informal speech sample during play and picture naming. Noted frequent final consonant deletions (e.g., \"ca\" for \"cat\"), reduced consonant blends, and substitutions for /k/ and /g/ (fronting to /t, d/). Intelligibility reduced in connected speech, especially for unfamiliar topics.\n\n2. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, m, t/)\n- Introduced final consonant targets at the imitated word level using picture cards (e.g., \"map, mop, mat, cup, ham\"). Child often omitted final sounds even with models. With maximal verbal cues (\"stop your sound,\" \"close your lips\"), could produce some clearer final consonants in isolation but had difficulty carrying over into words.\n\n3. Initial /k/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation using tongue-back placement cues and a mirror. Child produced a back sound inconsistently; often substituted /t/. With hand-over-hand placement cues on the throat and visual modeling, child approximated /k/ in isolation a few times. Limited success in CV syllables (\"koo, kah\"); required direct imitation and frequent reminders.\n\n4. Early word shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Targeted simple syllable shapes within play (e.g., \"moo, baa, baby, puppy\"). Child produced many CV and CVCV forms spontaneously but often reduced accuracy on specific consonants. Focus was on encouraging any clear consonant-vowel pattern rather than specific phonemes.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build rapport and maintain focus on final consonants and initial /k/ at the imitated word and syllable level.\n- Caregiver encouraged to model slow, clear CVC words in daily routines (e.g., \"cup, top, bed\") without pressuring child to repeat every time.\n- Next session: recheck tolerance for mirror work and continue establishing consistent /k/ in isolation, as well as final /p/ and /t/ in high-interest words."

Noted that child \"sometimes\" will copy short words when prompted, but final sounds are still usually missing. No concerns with hearing or general health.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated from caregiver with minimal difficulty today. Participated well in structured play at the table for short periods, then needed movement breaks. Responded positively to visual supports and turn-taking games.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants /p, t, m/ in CVC words (imitation)\n- Revisited picture naming for CVC words (\"cap, cup, map, mat, mop, cat\"). Child continued to omit many final consonants, but there were more attempts to \"close\" the word when cued. With maximal verbal and visual cueing (pointing to a stop sign picture, tapping the table for the last sound), child produced a small number of accurate final /p/ and /t/ productions. Final /m/ remained more challenging, often reduced to a vowel.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on /k/ in isolation with mirror and tongue-back cues. Child was able to produce a clearer /k/ sound intermittently when watching the clinician, though still reverted to /t/ frequently. In CV syllables (\"koo, key, kah\"), accuracy remained low; productions often sounded like /too, tee/. Child tolerated tactile cues to the throat and jaw.\n\n3. Early word shapes and functional words\n- Encouraged production of simple CV and CVCV words embedded in play (\"go, bye-bye, bunny, baby, open\"). Child produced several spontaneous CV and reduplicated CVCV forms. Focus remained on encouraging any clear attempts and reinforcing intelligible productions.\n\n4. Initial stimulability for /s/ and /f/\n- Briefly probed /s/ and /f/ in isolation. Child was able to blow air through the lips for /f/ with modeling but had difficulty coordinating voice and airflow. /s/ approximations tended to be lateral or stopped. No direct hierarchy work yet; this was purely exploratory.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Skills remain at early acquisition stage; continue at same level next session.\n- Caregiver encouraged to emphasize final sounds in a playful way (e.g., \"caT\" with a little tap on the table for the last sound), without demanding perfect repetitions.\n- Next session: maintain focus on final /p, t, m/ and initial /k/ in isolation and CV; consider using more movement-based games to support attention."

Reported occasional success hearing a final /p/ or /t/ when the child is very excited (e.g., \"pop\").\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered the room eagerly and was highly motivated by toy animals and a pretend kitchen set. Attention to adult-directed tasks improved compared to previous sessions, with fewer prompts needed to stay at the table. Responded well to visual schedules and praise.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants /p, t, m/ in CVC words (imitation → supported spontaneous)\n- Used picture cards and play (e.g., feeding the \"cat,\" putting items in a \"cup\"). Child showed improved consistency when imitating CVC words with strong visual and verbal cues. There were more recognizable final /p/ and /t/ productions, especially in high-interest words like \"pop\" and \"top.\" Child began to occasionally produce final consonants spontaneously in the play context after a model was given earlier in the activity. Accuracy still variable but clearly improved from baseline.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CV and CVC words (imitation)\n- Practiced /k/ in CV syllables (\"koo, key, kah\") and in a small set of CVC words (\"cat, cup, cow\") using mirror feedback and tongue-back cues. Child produced a true /k/ more frequently today in isolation and in some CV combinations. In CVC words, /k/ was sometimes correct but often fronted to /t/. Child responded well to the cue \"back sound\" and could correct with immediate imitation in a portion of trials.\n\n3. Functional CV/CVCV words in play\n- Targeted a set of functional words (\"go, up, open, mommy, baby, bubble\") within play routines. Child produced several of these spontaneously with clearer consonants. Some final consonants were still omitted, but overall intelligibility in structured routines (e.g., bubbles game) was slightly improved.\n\n4. Stimulability for /f/ in isolation and CV\n- Returned to /f/ briefly. With a mirror and the \"bite your lip and blow\" cue, child was able to produce a recognizable /f/ sound in isolation multiple times. Attempted a few CV syllables (\"fee, foo\") with emerging but inconsistent accuracy.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Given the moderate improvement in final consonant attempts and initial /k/, will continue at word level but begin to embed more supported spontaneous productions in play.\n- Caregiver encouraged to highlight and praise any clear final sounds at home (\"I heard your /p/ in 'cup'!\").\n- Next session: continue CVC practice for /p, t, m/ and /k/ in CV/CVC, gradually increasing opportunities for independent productions in familiar play routines."

Participated in table-top games and floor play with good engagement. Needed occasional redirection when becoming silly, but responded well to visual cues and choices.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants /p, t, m/ in CVC words (imitation and cued spontaneous)\n- Used picture scenes and simple board games to elicit target words (\"cup, top, map, mat, mop, cat, ham\"). Child demonstrated slightly higher accuracy with final /p/ and /t/ in imitation compared to last week and began to self-correct on a few attempts after hearing their own production. Final /m/ remained less consistent but showed more clear attempts. Some independent productions of CVC words occurred in the context of game play after a model was given earlier.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CV/CVC words (imitation, beginning phrases)\n- Practiced /k/ in CV syllables and in CVC words (\"key, car, cat, cup, cow\"). Child produced /k/ correctly in many isolated CV productions with verbal and visual cues. In CVC words, accuracy was mixed but trending upward; still fronted to /t/ at times. Tried a few short carrier phrases such as \"my cat\" and \"go car\" with clinician support; child could maintain /k/ in some phrase contexts when the word had been practiced first at the single-word level.\n\n3. Functional CVC/CVCV words in structured play\n- Integrated target words into pretend play (e.g., feeding the \"cat,\" pouring into a \"cup,\" saying \"open\" and \"up\"). Child produced several functional words with improved clarity and showed more willingness to repeat when misunderstood.\n\n4. Stimulability /f/ in isolation and initial position\n- Continued brief work on /f/ using mirror and visual cues. Child produced a recognizable /f/ in isolation with moderate support and attempted a few initial /f/ words (\"fish, fun, four\"). Accuracy remained emerging, with some substitutions or omission of the fricative.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Progress is emerging but still fragile; continue consolidating final consonants and initial /k/ at the word level before expanding further.\n- Caregiver encouraged to play simple \"listening games\" at home, emphasizing the last sound in words like \"up, top, pop.\"\n- Next session: maintain current targets; consider adding more structured phrase practice for words with more consistent accuracy."

Accuracy for final /p/ and /t/ in imitated and cued phrases was similar to last week. Child could include final consonants in many practiced words but remained inconsistent, especially as tasks became more conversational. Final /m/ remained adequate in a small set of high-frequency words.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CVC words and simple sentences\n- Practiced /k/ in words and short sentence frames (\"I see a cat,\" \"The cup is big\"). Child maintained previous gains in word-level accuracy and could often produce /k/ correctly in sentences when given a model and light reminders. Performance did not noticeably advance from the last session but remained solid at this level.\n\n3. Functional 2–3 word phrases\n- Encouraged the use of phrases such as \"my turn,\" \"more bubbles,\" and \"open it\" in play. Child continued to use these phrases with similar clarity to last week. Final consonants in connected speech were still inconsistent but present more often for well-practiced words.\n\n4. Initial /f/ in words\n- Briefly revisited /f/ words (\"fish, fun, four, food\"). Child produced /f/ with moderate accuracy in imitation but had difficulty maintaining it when attention waned. No major change from prior session; focus remained on consistency.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Skills appear stable at the current level. Will continue to provide practice at word, phrase, and short sentence levels to support consolidation before introducing new targets.\n- Caregiver encouraged to continue using the same set of practiced phrases at home, focusing on clear, slow models and praising attempts.\n- Next session: maintain current targets; monitor for readiness to generalize to less structured conversational contexts."

No significant changes noted since last week.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child was initially distracted by new toys in the room but settled into activities after a brief warm-up. Participated in both drill-based and play-based tasks with intermittent redirection. Motivation improved when able to choose between two activities.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants /p, t, m/ in CVC words and short phrases\n- Practiced familiar CVC words and phrases (\"my cup, big cat, mom's bed, top on\") within games and picture scenes. Child's accuracy for final /p/ and /t/ remained comparable to prior sessions, with good performance in structured imitation but variable inclusion of final consonants in more spontaneous contexts. Final /m/ continued to be most reliable in \"mom.\"\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CVC words and simple sentences\n- Continued targeting /k/ in words and sentences (\"I see a cat,\" \"The cup is big,\" \"The car is red\"). Child maintained accuracy for /k/ in many practiced words and could often carry this into sentence frames when given a model. Occasional fronting to /t/ persisted but was less frequent for highly familiar words.\n\n3. Functional phrases in play\n- Encouraged short phrases such as \"my turn,\" \"more bubbles,\" and \"help me\" in natural play routines. Child produced these phrases similarly to last week, with some clear productions and some omissions of final consonants. Clinician modeled and reinforced clearer productions without increasing task demands.\n\n4. Initial /f/ in words and isolation\n- Briefly worked on /f/ in isolation and initial words. Child was able to produce /f/ in isolation and a few words with visual cues but remained inconsistent. No significant shift in performance compared to recent sessions.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Given the stable performance, will continue to focus on consolidating accuracy at word, phrase, and simple sentence levels before expanding targets or increasing complexity.\n- Caregiver encouraged to use repetition and modeling in everyday routines (e.g., at snack time: \"cup, big cup, my cup\") and to keep practice short and positive.\n- Next session: maintain current goals and look for opportunities to support generalization in slightly less structured conversational exchanges."

At home, caregiver notices that child sometimes slows down and \"tries again\" when not understood.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child appeared cheerful and engaged. Transitioned smoothly and willingly participated in both structured tasks and play. Demonstrated good persistence and seemed proud of successful productions when given specific praise.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants /p, t, m/ in CVC words and short phrases\n- Revisited familiar CVC words and phrases in game-based tasks and simple role-play scenarios. Child continued to show similar levels of accuracy as in prior sessions, with reliable final /p/ and /t/ in many imitated productions and emerging but inconsistent use in more spontaneous speech. Final /m/ remained most consistent in \"mom\" and a few other high-frequency words.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CVC words, sentences, and semi-structured conversation\n- Practiced /k/ in short sentences (\"I see a cat,\" \"The car is big,\" \"Put it in the cup\") and then in brief, semi-structured conversational exchanges (e.g., talking about favorite animals). Child maintained good accuracy for /k/ in many rehearsed sentences. In more open conversation, /k/ was sometimes correct in familiar words but still occasionally fronted. Overall performance was in line with recent sessions.\n\n3. Functional phrases and short sentences\n- Encouraged child to use 2–4 word combinations (\"my turn now,\" \"I want bubbles,\" \"help me please\") during play and structured routines. Child produced several clear phrases, with target words often more intelligible when they had been previously practiced in isolation or short sentences.\n\n4. Initial /f/ in isolation and words\n- Continued brief practice of /f/ in isolation and initial position (\"fish, fun, four\"). Child's productions were similar to last week—able to generate /f/ with support and produce a few words correctly, but not yet consistent across trials.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Skills appear to be consolidating at the current level, with some early signs of generalization to school. Will continue current targets to support stability and carryover.\n- Caregiver encouraged to share therapy target words with preschool staff so they can reinforce them in the classroom (e.g., \"cup, cat, car\").\n- Next session: maintain focus on final consonants and /k/ in short sentences and semi-structured conversation, while continuing light stimulability work for /f/."

Child reportedly enjoys practicing some of their \"special words\" like \"cat\" and \"cup\" at home.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned easily and showed good engagement in both structured activities and free play. Demonstrated good effort and responded positively to specific feedback about sound production.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants /p, t, m/ in CVC words, phrases, and short sentences\n- Practiced CVC words and expanded into short sentences (\"The cup is full,\" \"The cat is big,\" \"Mom is home\"). Child's performance was consistent with recent sessions: strong in imitated and cued contexts, with variable but present final consonants in more spontaneous speech. Self-corrections were observed when the clinician gently highlighted missing final sounds.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CVC words, sentences, and semi-structured conversation\n- Targeted /k/ in short sentence frames and in brief conversational exchanges about pictures and toys. Child produced /k/ accurately in many rehearsed sentences and in a number of spontaneous uses of familiar words (e.g., \"cat,\" \"car,\" \"cup\"). Occasional fronting remained, particularly when speaking quickly or about new topics.\n\n3. Functional 2–4 word sentences for communication\n- Encouraged child to use short, functional sentences such as \"I want more,\" \"my turn now,\" and \"help me please\" during play. Many phrases were produced with clearer consonants in the practiced target words, though overall intelligibility still fluctuated with length and complexity of utterance.\n\n4. Initial /f/ stimulability and simple words\n- Briefly continued stimulability work for /f\" in isolation and a few initial words (\"fish, four, fun\"). Child's productions were similar to previous sessions, with recognizable /f/ in isolation and some correct word-level attempts when closely supported.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Skills are holding steady at the current level with gradual functional gains. Recommend continued speech therapy to further improve consistency of final consonants and /k/ in less structured conversation and to advance /f/ beyond the stimulable stage.\n- Caregiver encouraged to keep practicing a small set of target words and simple sentences at home (e.g., \"I see a cat,\" \"Drink from the cup\"), focusing on slow, clear models and positive reinforcement.\n- Next block (if continued): consider formally introducing /f/ as a structured target and expanding sentence-level goals for /k/ and final consonants in everyday conversational contexts."

No major changes since the initial assessment.\n- Family has begun trying to slow the child down and ask them to “say it again,” but they are unsure how to cue specific sounds.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned into the therapy room with minimal hesitation, observed to be curious and friendly.\n- Engaged well in play-based activities, with occasional silliness that required gentle redirection back to speech tasks.\n- Attended to therapist’s face for short periods when prompted, but often looked away during longer explanations.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. Baseline for initial /s/ at the word level (imitation)\n- Target words included: sun, soap, sock, sit, soup.\n- Child typically substituted /t/ or /d/ for /s/ in initial position (e.g., “tun” for sun, “doap” for soap).\n- With direct imitation and visual cue to “keep your tongue behind your teeth,” child produced an accurate /s/ in about half of attempts; accuracy decreased without a model.\n\n2. Baseline for /s/ blends in initial position (word level imitation)\n- Probed words: stop, snow, spoon, star, slide.\n- Frequent reduction of blends to single consonants (e.g., “top” for stop, “no” for snow), or distortion of /s/ to a more /sh/‑like sound.\n- Even with simultaneous production and slowed rate, child showed limited success in marking both consonants; required maximal verbal and visual cueing.\n\n3. Baseline for final consonants in CVC words\n- Probed final /p, t, m, k/ in simple words (e.g., pop, hat, ham, back).\n- In spontaneous play, final sounds were often omitted (“ba” for back, “ha” for hat). With imitation, child marked some final consonants but productions were inconsistent.\n- When the clinician used tapping or pointing for each sound, child was able to include the final consonant occasionally, but needed repeated models.\n\n4. Syllable structure and early phrases\n- Observed CV, CVC, and some CVCV (reduplicated) word shapes during play (e.g., “mama,” “baba,” “puppy”).\n- Child used many 2–3 word phrases spontaneously (e.g., “my car,” “more bubbles,” “I want that”), though overall intelligibility was reduced due to sound errors.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Begin structured practice of initial /s/ at the imitated word level, using mirrors and simple visual cues.\n- Introduce very simple /s/ blends (e.g., “stop,” “snow”) in imitation only, focusing on awareness that there are “two sounds at the start.”\n- Encourage caregiver to model slower, clear speech at home and to repeat the child’s words back with correct sounds (e.g., “tun – yes, sun”).\n- Continue to monitor final consonant production in play and consider a specific final consonant goal in upcoming sessions."

Initial /s/ at imitated word level\n- Practiced words: sun, soup, sit, sad, sock.\n- With a clear model plus visual cue to “smile and keep your tongue behind your teeth,” child produced /s/ accurately in most attempts.\n- Able to correct some productions after feedback (e.g., “tun” → therapist model → “sun”).\n- Compared to baseline, productions were noticeably clearer and more consistent, with fewer substitutions to /t/.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in simple carrier phrase (“my ___”) – emerging\n- Once accuracy was established in single words, therapist introduced short phrases (e.g., “my sun,” “my soup”) using imitation.\n- Child was able to maintain /s/ in about half of the attempts; in others, /s/ was reduced or changed to /t/.\n- Required moderate cueing to slow down and say each word separately.\n\n3. /s/ blends at imitated word level\n- Target words: stop, star, spoon, slide.\n- Child continued to reduce blends (e.g., “top,” “tar,” “poon”), but there were a few clear attempts where both sounds were audible, especially with backward chaining (e.g., practicing “tar” → “star”).\n- Tolerated visual cues (pointing to two blocks for the two starting sounds) and began to recognize when the /s/ was missing.\n\n4. Final consonants in CVC words\n- Focused on final /p/ and /m/ (e.g., pop, up, mop, mom).\n- With imitation and tapping cues, child marked the final consonant more frequently than baseline, though still inconsistently.\n- Occasional spontaneous final consonants noted during play (e.g., “pop” during bubble game), suggesting early carryover.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue building consistency for initial /s/ at word level and expand phrase-level practice when accuracy is strong.\n- Maintain /s/ blend practice using backward chaining and visual “two sound” cues.\n- Send home a short list of /s/ words with pictures for caregiver to practice 3–5 minutes daily, focusing on slow, clear productions.\n- Continue monitoring frustration and provide caregiver strategies for positive feedback when the child is trying hard."

She notices that familiar family members usually understand, but peers and less familiar adults have difficulty.\n- No major changes since the evaluation; parent is most concerned about unclear words and frustration when not understood.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with brief hesitation but separated from parent without tears.\n- Engaged well with toys and activities when they were play-based. Attention was variable; needed frequent redirection from self-directed play back to practice tasks.\n- Responded positively to praise and sticker rewards.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: Establish /k/ in isolation and simple syllables (back sound vs. front sound)\n- Targeted /k/ in isolation using mirror, tongue depressor for awareness only (no placement), and visual of \"back sound\" vs. \"front sound.\"\n- Child often substituted /t/ for /k/ in spontaneous play. With direct imitation and models, child achieved a few accurate /k/ productions but required maximal verbal and visual cueing (e.g., \"tongue up and back\").\n- Able to produce /k/ in isolation in approximately 3–4 clear attempts during the session; difficulty carrying over to syllables (e.g., \"koo,\" \"kah\").\n\nGoal 2: Initial /f/ at syllable and early word level (imitation)\n- Introduced /f/ using \"quiet lip air\" cue and mirror work. Child tended to stop /f/ to /p/ in spontaneous attempts.\n- In imitation of simple syllables (\"foo, fee, fa\"), child produced a few accurate productions but frequently reverted to /p/ or omitted the airflow.\n- At word level with strong models (\"fish, fun, four\"), accuracy was low and required maximal verbal and gestural cueing.\n\nGoal 3: CV/CVC syllable shapes for clarity in play\n- Observed inconsistent marking of final consonants in CVC words during play (e.g., \"ca_\" for \"cat,\" \"do_\" for \"dog\").\n- Practiced a small set of high-interest CVC words (\"dog, cat, hat, pop\") in imitation. Child could approximate final consonants when given slowed rate and segmented models but did not yet produce them consistently.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to focus on establishing /k/ and /f/ at the isolation and simple syllable levels next session; maintain strong visual and verbal cueing.\n- Encourage parent to model slow, clear productions of key words at home (e.g., \"cat,\" \"dog,\" \"cup\") without pressuring the child to repeat.\n- Plan to gather additional baseline data on final consonant production and consider adding specific final consonant goals once more stable.\n"

Child produced /k/ in isolation with moderate cues more consistently than last week.\n- Introduced CV syllables (\"koo, kah, kee\").

Early self-correction emerging.\n\nGoal 2: Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced /f/ in isolation using \"lip bite and blow\" cue.

Accuracy remained variable, but more final consonant attempts were observed compared to last session.\n- Child benefited from visual tapping (one tap per sound) to support awareness of the final sound.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue building consistency for /k/ and /f/ at CV syllable and simple word level; maintain use of segmentation and visual cues.\n- Encourage parent to use the \"slow and stretchy\" model at home for target words, praising any attempts rather than only correct productions.\n- Plan to introduce a small set of high-frequency /k/ and /f/ words next session if accuracy at the CV level remains similar.\n"

Attention span was fair; he needed occasional redirection back to speech tasks.\n- Responded well to visual supports and turn-taking games.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1) Establish production of early consonants in isolation (p, b, m, t, d, k, g)\n- Probed in play and structured imitation. /p, b, m, t, d/ generally present in simple CV syllables (e.g., \"bee,\" \"moo\"), but final consonants were frequently omitted in CVC words (e.g., \"boo\" for \"boat\").\n- /k, g/ were often fronted to /t, d/ in both imitation and spontaneous attempts (e.g., \"tar\" for \"car\").\n- With direct modeling and gesture cues (tapping throat vs. lips), he could occasionally imitate /k/ in isolation but had difficulty carrying it into syllables.\n\n2) Final consonant production at the imitated word level (CVC words)\n- Targeted final /p, m, t/ using picture cards and simple games (e.g., \"pop,\" \"map,\" \"cat\").\n- Frequently omitted final sounds or added a neutral vowel (\"puh\"). Needed maximal verbal cueing (\"keep your sound on\") and visual cues (pointing to lips) to mark the final consonant.\n- Achieved a small number of clearly marked final consonants with simultaneous production (saying it together with SLP); independent productions were inconsistent.\n\n3) Initial /f/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Introduced /f/ using visual cue of \"bite your lip and blow.\" In isolation, he could approximate /f/ with heavy cueing but often substituted /p/ or produced a prolonged /h/ sound.\n- In CV syllables (\"foo,\" \"fee\"), productions were mostly /p/ or omitted the consonant. Required maximal modeling and repetition.\n\n4) Initial /s/ in isolation\n- Attempted /s/ in isolation with mirror and snake visuals. Productions were often /d/ or a lateralized sound; sustained airflow was difficult.\n- Tolerated placement cues (smile, teeth together, long air) but needed hand-over-hand support for airflow.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to build consistent production of final consonants in CVC words and explore stimulability for /k, g, f, s/ at the isolation and syllable levels.\n- Provide parent with simple home practice ideas for final sounds (e.g., \"pop,\" \"map,\" \"hat\") using slow, exaggerated models.\n- Next session: further assess stimulability for /k/ and /f/, and begin a small set of core CVC words for practice."

Still frequently omitted or reduced final consonants in spontaneous play, but accuracy in structured imitation was meaningfully higher.\n\n2) Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Focused on back-of-the-tongue placement using a puppet and \"cough\" trick.\n- Demonstrated improved stimulability: could imitate /k/ in isolation multiple times with moderate verbal and visual cues, versus only rare approximations last week.\n- In CV syllables (\"koo,\" \"kee\"), productions were mixed; about half of attempts were closer to /k/ rather than /t/ when given slowed models and placement reminders.\n\n3) Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued to use \"bite your lip and blow\" cue. He was more willing to look in the mirror and watch the SLP's mouth.\n- Produced clearer /f/ in isolation intermittently with moderate cues. Still tended to default to /p/ in syllables, but there were a few accurate CV productions (e.g., \"fee\") when slowed down and given extra modeling.\n- Emerging accuracy noted; still needs substantial support, but performance improved compared to baseline.\n\n4) Early /s/ work in isolation\n- Briefly revisited /s/ in isolation; airflow still challenging, and productions often sounded like /t/ or a distorted fricative.\n- Tolerated tactile and visual cues but required maximal support; /s/ remains a longer-term target.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue targeting final consonants in a small core set of CVC words, building consistency at the imitated level.\n- Maintain focus on /k/ and /f/ in isolation and CV syllables given increased stimulability; consider moving a few /k/ CV syllables into simple words if accuracy holds.\n- Encourage parent to practice 3–5 CVC words daily with slow, clear models and lots of praise for any final sound attempts."

In spontaneous comments during play, final consonants were still often omitted but occasional marked finals were heard without prompting.\n\n2) Initial /k/ at syllable and simple word level (imitation)\n- Built from CV syllables to a few early /k/ words (\"car, key, cow\") using picture supports.\n- Accuracy in CV syllables improved; he produced /k/ rather than /t/ in most imitated attempts when given a visual cue (hand at throat) and slowed model.\n- At the single-word level, he could imitate \"car\" and \"key\" with a recognizable /k/ in many trials, though \"cow\" remained more challenging. Still needed frequent reminders for back-of-tongue placement, but less physical prompting than before.\n\n3) Initial /f/ in isolation, CV, and early word probes\n- Continued with mirror and lip-bite cue. Demonstrated more consistent /f/ in isolation with moderate verbal cueing.\n- In CV syllables (\"fee,\" \"fo\"), accuracy was improved, with several clear productions when paced.\n- Briefly probed \"fish\" and \"foot\"; he approximated /f/ but often shifted to /p/ at faster rates. Moderate, meaningful progress noted from prior sessions, but not yet ready for phrase-level work.\n\n4) Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV) for overall intelligibility\n- Observed in play that he uses a range of CV and CVCV shapes. When excited, tends to reduce CVC to CV or CVCV with omitted finals.\n- With clinician modeling and visual tapping of syllables, he was able to approximate 2–3 syllable words (\"banana,\" \"dinosaur\") with most syllables present, though individual sounds were not always clear.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to solidify final consonants in the current CVC set; if consistency remains, consider adding new words or moving a few into short carrier phrases (e.g., \"my cat\").\n- Maintain focus on /k/ at word level in imitation; expand list slightly as accuracy improves.\n- Continue practicing /f/ in CV syllables and a very small number of simple words, keeping expectations at the imitated level.\n- Home: encourage slow, clear practice of 5–7 target words, praising any attempts to keep the \"end sound.\""

Still inconsistent, but this represents emerging independent use.\n\n2) Initial /k/ in words and early carrier phrases\n- Practiced /k/ in initial position in a small set of words (\"car, key, cow, cookie\") using picture scenes.\n- Accuracy in imitation was good when he slowed down; he needed only light verbal reminders for back-of-tongue placement.\n- Trialed simple carrier phrases (\"my car,\" \"go car\") with clinician model. He was able to maintain /k/ in some phrase-level attempts, though it was less consistent than at the single-word level.\n\n3) Initial /f/ in CV syllables and simple words (imitation)\n- Focused on CV syllables and a few functional words (\"feet,\" \"fun,\" \"fish\").\n- With visual and verbal cues, he produced more consistent /f/ sounds, especially in CV forms. In words, he still occasionally substituted /p/, but there were several clearly recognizable /f/ productions.\n- Independence is slowly improving; still mostly needs models, but less intensive cueing than earlier sessions.\n\n4) Early /s/ exploration in isolation\n- Brief check-in on /s/ in isolation with mirror and snake visuals.\n- Still presents with difficulty sustaining airflow and tends to shift to /t/; required maximal support. /s/ remains a future focus once current targets are more solid.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating final consonants in CVC words and monitor spontaneous use during play.\n- Maintain /k/ practice at word level and short phrases as tolerated, focusing on slow and clear productions.\n- Continue to strengthen /f/ at the imitated word level, adding a few highly functional words.\n- Home: parent to practice 5–10 minutes daily using target picture cards, emphasizing slow speech and praising any final sound or /k/ and /f/ attempts."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\nMom shared that she and Dad notice that speech is still \"hard to understand\" for unfamiliar listeners. She reported that he often leaves off sounds at the ends of words and says \"do\" for \"go\" and \"tat\" for \"cat.\" No major changes since the evaluation. Family is motivated to work on \"clear sounds\" and is open to home practice.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned with some hesitation but separated from Mom with reassurance and a visual schedule. He was curious and talkative in play, occasionally becoming silly and needing reminders to use his \"practice voice\" for target words. Attention to table-top tasks was fair; he benefited from frequent movement breaks and using toys as part of drill play.\n\nGoals/targets this session:\n1. Establish production of /k/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- At baseline, client substituted /t/ for /k/ in all word positions (e.g., \"tar\" for \"car\").\n- With mirror, tongue-back visuals, and tactile cue to throat, he approximated /k/ in isolation in about half of attempts; many productions were closer to /t/ or omitted. He responded best to a whispered /k/ and to pairing with a big yawn.\n- In CV syllables (\"koo, kah, kee\"), accuracy was low and required maximal modeling and simultaneous production.\n\n2. Establish production of /f/ in isolation and initial position of words\n- Client often replaced /f/ with /b/ or omitted it (\"ish\" for \"fish\").\n- With a strong \"bite lip, blow\" visual cue, he produced /f/ in isolation fairly consistently when watching in the mirror.\n- At the imitated CV level (\"fee, foo, fah\"), productions were inconsistent; he sometimes used /p/ or a labial stop.\n\n3. Final consonant awareness and production\n- In spontaneous play, frequent final consonant deletion noted (e.g., \"tea\" for \"teeth,\" \"do\" for \"dog\").\n- Used minimal pairs with picture cards (e.g., \"bee\" vs. \"beep,\" \"bow\" vs. \"boat\"). He could hear the difference when the clinician exaggerated final sounds, but was not yet able to reliably add the final consonant in imitation.\n\n4. Functional communication – clear words for key wants/needs\n- Identified a small set of functional words to target for clarity (e.g., \"more,\" \"go,\" \"up,\" \"mine\").\n- Client willingly imitated these with varying clarity; consonants were often simplified, but intent was clear in context.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to build accurate /k/ and /f/ in isolation and CV syllables before moving into word-level practice.\n- Encourage Mom to model \"bite lip and blow\" for /f/ during daily routines (e.g., \"food,\" \"fish,\" \"four\").\n- Provide parent with simple visuals for /k/ (\"back sound\") and /f/ (\"lip-bite sound\").\n- Next session: re-check /k/ and /f/ in isolation, begin structured word-level practice for whichever sound stabilizes first, and continue monitoring final consonant use in play."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\nMom reported that she has been trying the \"lip-bite and blow\" cue at home and feels he is \"starting to get the f sound\" in a few words like \"food.\" She still hears \"tat\" for \"cat\" most of the time. No concerns with hearing or health this week.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient entered the room more easily today and quickly engaged with a car and animal play set. He accepted turn-taking drills when they were embedded in play (e.g., say a target word before pushing the car). He needed some redirection away from making silly noises, but responded to visual reminders and praise for clear productions.\n\nGoals/targets this session:\n1. /f/ production – isolation to initial word level\n- Reviewed /f/ in isolation using mirror and \"bite lip, blow\" cue. Accuracy was high when he was focused; he was able to self-correct a few times after an inaccurate attempt.\n- Advanced to initial /f/ at the imitated word level (e.g., \"fish, fan, five, foot, fun\"). Accuracy was emerging: some clear /f/ productions, some substitutions with /p/ or /b/, and occasional omission. Continued to require direct modeling and visual cueing.\n\n2. /k/ production – isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued to show fronting of /k/ to /t/ in spontaneous play.\n- In isolation, he produced a recognizable /k/ with heavy cueing (mirror, tongue-back gesture, \"cough\" trick). Accuracy was slightly better than last week but still inconsistent.\n- In CV syllables (\"koo, kah\"), productions often slipped back to /t/ or were distorted; required maximal support.\n\n3. Final consonant awareness – VC and CVC imitation\n- Practiced short VC and CVC words in imitation (e.g., \"up, in, out, boat, beep, map\").\n- He occasionally marked a final consonant when given an exaggerated model and visual cue to \"tap the sound at the end,\" but this was not yet consistent.\n- He enjoyed a stamping game to \"stamp\" when he heard the sound at the end; receptive discrimination was stronger than expressive production.\n\n4. Functional word clarity\n- Continued to model and elicit clearer productions of key functional words (\"go, up, more, mine\").\n- With a model, he could add a slightly stronger final consonant in some words (e.g., \"up\" vs. \"uh\").\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on /f/ in initial words, aiming to increase consistency at the imitated word level.\n- Continue shaping /k/ in isolation; not yet ready for consistent word-level practice.\n- Encourage parent to highlight /f/ words in daily routines and praise any clear attempts.\n- Provide a short list of VC/CVC words with visuals for home play, focusing on hearing and attempting final sounds without pressure for perfection."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\nMom shared that he is now sometimes saying a clearer /f/ in a few familiar words like \"fish\" and \"food\" without being reminded, especially when excited. She continues to hear many \"t\" sounds for \"k\" words. She noted that grandparents still have difficulty understanding him on the phone.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned smoothly and appeared excited to show the clinician his toy car. He participated well in structured tasks when they were presented as games (e.g., \"feed the shark\" with picture cards). He tolerated brief drill segments at the table and then requested play breaks. Overall attention and cooperation were good with visual countdowns.\n\nGoals/targets this session:\n1. /f/ initial – word and emerging phrase level\n- At the imitated word level (\"fish, fan, five, foot, four, fun\"), accuracy was noticeably better than previous sessions. He produced a clear /f/ at the beginning of many words with only a verbal reminder (\"bite lip, blow\") rather than full visual support.\n- Introduced simple carrier phrases (\"my ___\", \"big ___\") with a few /f/ words (\"my fish,\" \"big foot\"). He was able to maintain /f/ in some phrases when given a slow model.\n- Spontaneous use: produced a few clear /f/ words during play (\"fish!\" and \"find it\") without prompting.\n\n2. /k/ production – isolation to CV syllables\n- Continued fronting to /t/ in spontaneous speech.\n- In structured practice, he was more consistently able to produce /k/ in isolation when using the \"cough\" or \"back sound\" cue. Accuracy improved compared to last week, though he still needed frequent reminders.\n- In CV syllables (\"koo, kah, kee\"), he produced several accurate attempts with simultaneous production and then imitation. Accuracy was emerging but not yet stable.\n\n3. Final consonants – CVC words in imitation\n- Practiced CVC words with early consonants (\"map, boat, feet, cup, moon\").\n- He marked final consonants more often today when the clinician used a visual tap or block to represent the last sound. Many productions were approximations but demonstrated increased awareness (e.g., \"ma(p)\" with a quiet /p/).\n\n4. Functional clarity in play\n- During play, he attempted several 2–3 word combinations (e.g., \"my car go,\" \"more bubbles,\" \"I want that\").\n- Intelligibility within the context of play was fair; listener support and context clues were still needed.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen /f/ at the word level and gradually expand phrase use as consistency allows.\n- Maintain focused practice on /k/ in isolation and CV syllables; not yet ready for consistent word-level targets.\n- Encourage parents to notice and praise any spontaneous /f/ productions and to model slow, clear speech for CVC words.\n- Next session: consider adding a small set of /f/ words for phrase-level practice if gains are maintained; continue building final consonant marking with visual supports."

She noted that he often leaves off the ends of words and sometimes says “tup” for “cup.” No concerns about hearing or overall health this week.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned with mild hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance. He engaged well in play-based activities, responded to visual supports, and tolerated sitting at the table for short segments. Attention was variable but generally adequate with frequent movement breaks.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants (p, t, m) in CVC words – imitation level\n- Introduced final /p, t, m/ in simple CVC words (e.g., cup, cat, mom) using picture cards and play routines. Client imitated some targets but frequently omitted the final consonant or added a vowel (e.g., “cu-” for cup, “ca-” for cat). Needed consistent visual cues (pointing to mouth, tapping for final sound) and verbal reminders to “keep the sound on.” Accuracy was low and productions were inconsistent.\n\n2. Initial /k/ vs /t/ contrast – isolation and simple syllables\n- Targeted back vs front sounds using a “back sound” vs “front sound” game. Client was able to approximate /k/ in isolation with maximal verbal and visual cueing (open mouth, “tongue in the back”) but frequently substituted /t/ in CV syllables (e.g., “too” for “koo”). Difficulty carrying over from isolation to syllables.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation with a “snake sound” visual. Client could sustain a prolonged /s/ with models, but productions were sometimes distorted or stopped. In CV syllables (e.g., “see,” “soo”), accuracy decreased, with substitutions to /d/ or omission. Required direct imitation and modeling; no spontaneous use noted.\n\n4. Two-word combinations with clear key words\n- During play, encouraged two-word phrases that highlighted target sounds (e.g., “big cup,” “my cat,” “see snake”). Client produced several two-word combinations, but target sounds were often reduced or omitted. Focus was on exposure and shaping rather than accuracy.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue to target final consonants in CVC words and initial /k/ and /s/ at the isolation and simple syllable levels with high support. Encourage parents to model slow, clear speech at home and emphasize final sounds in daily routines (e.g., “cuP,” “caT,” “baTH”) without pressuring for imitation. Next session will further probe which consonants are stimulable at the syllable and word level."

She still feels others have difficulty understanding him in longer phrases. No new medical or developmental concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient entered the therapy room more easily today and quickly engaged with toys. Attention to structured tasks was improved compared to last session, with fewer redirections needed. He responded well to turn-taking games and accepted cues without frustration.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants (p, t, m) in CVC words – imitation and emerging spontaneous attempts\n- Continued practice with final /p, t, m/ using picture cards and a “feeding the puppet” game. Compared with last session, client produced more consistent final consonants in imitation, especially for /p/ and /m/ (e.g., “cup,” “map,” “mom”). Still occasionally dropped final /t/, but with verbal cueing (“keep your sound at the end”) he was able to add it in a second attempt. A few spontaneous productions with clearer final sounds were observed during play (“up,” “pop”), suggesting early carryover.\n\n2. Initial /k/ vs /t/ – CV and CVC syllables\n- Practiced “back sound /k/” in CV (koo, key, kah) and simple CVC words (cup, cat, car). Client showed improved ability to produce /k/ in CV syllables with modeling and a mirror, with fewer /t/ substitutions. In CVC words, accuracy remained variable, but he was more willing to attempt correction when given feedback (e.g., “try your back sound”).\n\n3. Initial /s/ – isolation and CV syllables\n- Revisited /s/ in isolation and CV syllables using a “snake puppet” and visual cue for teeth together. Client’s isolated /s/ was more consistent today with less stopping. In CV syllables (see, soo, saa), he was able to approximate /s/ at the beginning of the syllable more frequently with verbal and visual cues, though some productions were still substituted or omitted.\n\n4. Two-word combinations featuring target sounds\n- Encouraged phrases such as “my cup,” “see car,” “big sun” during play. Client produced several two-word combinations; target sounds were more audible in imitation than in spontaneous attempts. Still relies on models for clearer productions.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nMaintain current focus on final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/ at the word and syllable level, as skills are beginning to emerge. Provide parents with a short list of practice words for final /p/ and /m/ to use in play (e.g., pop, up, map, nap, mom). Next session will continue to strengthen consistency and begin to probe whether any targets are ready to move toward short carrier phrases in structured tasks."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\nMom reported that he is starting to correct himself occasionally, especially on words like “cup” and “pop,” after she models them. She feels some single words are clearer, but sentences are still hard to understand. No new concerns at home or daycare.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient was cheerful and eager to show toys. He maintained engagement in table-top tasks for longer stretches and followed simple directions well. Mild silliness at times, but easily redirected with visual supports and choice-making.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants (p, t, m, k) in CVC words – imitation and early carrier phrases\n- Practiced final /p, t, m, k/ in CVC words using a board game and picture cards. Compared with last week, accuracy in imitation increased noticeably, with clearer final consonants on many trials (e.g., “cup, cap, cat, back, mom”). He required fewer repetitions and was able to add missing final sounds when cued. Trialed simple carrier phrases (e.g., “my cup,” “I see cat”) with moderate support; final sounds were sometimes maintained in these short phrases, though consistency decreased compared to single words.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CV and CVC words – imitation and minimal pairs\n- Focused on distinguishing /k/ from /t/ using minimal pairs (e.g., key/tea, car/tar). Client showed improved accuracy for /k/ in initial position in imitation, especially when reminded to use his “back sound.” He could correctly identify which word the clinician said most of the time and made more accurate attempts to match it. Occasional fronting to /t/ still occurred, but he responded to cues to “make it in the back.”\n\n3. Initial /s/ in CV and simple CVC words\n- Continued practice with /s/ at the beginning of words in a “snake race” game. Client produced more consistent initial /s/ in CV syllables (see, soo, saa) with visual and verbal cues. In simple CVC words (sun, soup, sock), accuracy was emerging; he sometimes substituted /d/ or omitted the sound, but showed increasing willingness to adjust his productions when prompted.\n\n4. Short carrier phrases with target words\n- Used repetitive carrier phrases such as “I want ___,” “my ___,” and “see ___” with target words containing final consonants or initial /k/ and /s/. Client could imitate short phrases with support and occasionally produced them spontaneously in play. Target sounds were clearer in imitation than in independent use, but overall phrase length and willingness to talk were strengths.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nGiven the moderate gains in final consonant and initial /k/ production, continue to build consistency at the word level while gradually increasing use in short phrases in structured play. Provide parents with 5–6 practice words for final /p, t, m, k/ and encourage modeling within simple phrases (e.g., “big cup,” “hot cat”). Next session will further trial carrier phrases and monitor readiness to expand to more spontaneous use in play."

She has noticed that he sometimes uses clearer speech when he slows down. Daycare staff still report reduced intelligibility in group settings.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned smoothly and participated actively in both play-based and structured tasks. He was motivated by turn-taking games and stickers and accepted feedback well. Attention was good, with only brief breaks needed.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants (p, t, m, k) in CVC words and short phrases\n- Continued work on final consonants in a picture-matching and “shopping” game. Compared with last session, productions were more consistent at the single-word level, especially for /p/ and /m/. Final /t/ and /k/ were improving but still less stable. In short phrases (e.g., “my cup,” “big cat,” “in back”), he was able to maintain the final consonant more often than previously, though accuracy still dropped relative to single words.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CVC words and simple phrases\n- Practiced initial /k/ in words like car, cat, key, cup using play with cars and pretend food. Client produced /k/ more reliably in imitation with fewer /t/ substitutions. In short phrases (“go car,” “my car,” “key please”), he was able to approximate /k/ with moderate verbal cueing. He sometimes self-corrected after hearing the clinician’s model.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in CVC words – imitation level\n- Targeted initial /s/ in words (sun, sock, soup, soap) using a “sorting” activity. Accuracy in imitation was slightly better than last session but remained inconsistent. He occasionally produced a stopped or distorted version of /s/. Visual cues (showing teeth, long air sound) were still needed, and carryover to phrases was not yet targeted.\n\n4. Short carrier phrases to support intelligibility\n- Used repetitive phrases (“I want ___,” “see my ___,” “put in ___”) with target words containing final consonants or initial /k/. Client imitated these phrases with relatively good prosody, and some spontaneous phrases emerged in play. Overall clarity of short phrases was slightly improved when he focused and accepted cues.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue strengthening final consonant production and initial /k/ in both single words and short phrases, as gains are building. Maintain initial /s/ at the word level until productions become more consistent before moving to phrases. At home, parents are encouraged to prompt slower speech and model short, clear phrases rather than long sentences. Next session will reinforce these targets and probe for any emerging spontaneous use of final consonants in unstructured play."

She mentioned that he is starting to be understood a bit more by extended family. She continues to hear him leave off some end sounds when he talks quickly.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient arrived in good spirits and transitioned independently into the room. He participated well in both floor play and table activities, with good turn-taking and responsiveness to cues. Mild fatigue noted near the end of the session, but he remained cooperative.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants (p, t, m, k) – word level and structured phrases\n- Practiced final consonants in a “treasure hunt” game with picture cards and small objects. Compared to last week, final consonant productions remained fairly consistent, with slightly increased accuracy for final /t/ and /k/. He continued to do well with /p/ and /m/ in imitation and was beginning to produce some clear final sounds during less structured play (e.g., “pop,” “up,” “mom”) without direct prompting. In short phrases, accuracy was similar to previous session, with emerging self-monitoring.\n\n2. Initial /k/ – word level and phrases\n- Used toy cars and animals to practice initial /k/ words (car, cat, cow, key). Client maintained his improved performance, producing /k/ correctly in many imitated words and some short phrases (e.g., “my car,” “big cow”) when cued. He still occasionally fronted to /t/ but responded to a simple reminder (“back sound”) to adjust.\n\n3. Initial /s/ – CVC words\n- Continued focus on initial /s/ using a “sunny day” and “silly sock” game. Accuracy remained similar to last session, with intermittent correct productions in imitation and ongoing need for visual cues. He could sometimes produce a clear /s/ in isolation, but carryover into words was inconsistent. No advancement to phrases yet.\n\n4. Short, functional phrases to support communication\n- Encouraged use of short, functional phrases (e.g., “I want car,” “more pop,” “my turn”) throughout play. Client imitated phrases readily and produced some spontaneously. Intelligibility within these short, practiced phrases was slightly better, though not yet consistently clear for unfamiliar listeners.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nMaintain current targets as skills are consolidating. Continue to emphasize final consonants and initial /k/ in home routines, praising any clear productions. Provide mom with visual cue ideas (e.g., tapping the table for the final sound). Next session will reassess initial /s/ for potential changes and continue to monitor for readiness to expand phrase-level work for /s/ once word-level accuracy improves."

She noted that he still becomes harder to understand when excited or talking quickly. No changes in health or hearing.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient was calm and cooperative throughout the session. He followed routines easily, engaged in both structured tasks and pretend play, and responded positively to praise. Attention span was adequate, and he tolerated brief correction and re-dos without frustration.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants (p, t, m, k) – consolidation at word and short-phrase level\n- Continued practice with final consonants using a board game and “hide and seek” with picture cards. Compared to previous sessions, accuracy remained relatively stable, with ongoing strength in final /p/ and /m/ and gradually improving /t/ and /k/. He maintained clearer final consonants in many imitated words and some short phrases (e.g., “my cup,” “big map”). Spontaneous use of final consonants appeared occasionally in play but was not yet consistent.\n\n2. Initial /k/ – word and phrase level\n- Practiced initial /k/ within themed play (cars, kitchen). Client produced /k/ accurately in many imitated words and several short phrases with minimal cueing. He still fronted /k/ in more complex or less familiar words, but he was increasingly aware of the need for a “back sound” when reminded. Performance was similar to last week, indicating consolidation.\n\n3. Initial /s/ – CVC words, imitation\n- Revisited initial /s/ words (sun, soup, sock, soap, sit) using picture cards and a simple sorting game. Accuracy showed subtle improvement but remained variable, with correct productions mixed with omissions or substitutions. Visual cues (teeth together, long air sound) were still required. Did not yet move to phrase level.\n\n4. Functional phrase practice and intelligibility\n- Used predictable routines (snack play, car race) to elicit short phrases (e.g., “my turn,” “go car,” “more please”). Client produced these with increasing ease. Intelligibility within these practiced phrases was somewhat better than in unstructured conversation but still inconsistent.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue current focus as skills are stabilizing, particularly final consonants and initial /k/. Maintain initial /s/ at the word level until accuracy is more consistent. Recommend that parents continue modeling short, clear phrases and highlight final consonants in natural contexts. Next session will aim to gently increase the complexity of phrases for final consonant targets while monitoring overall clarity."

He engaged well in both structured and play-based tasks, with good cooperation and response to feedback. He showed increased willingness to attempt self-corrections when given gentle prompts.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants (p, t, m, k) – expanded phrase level\n- Practiced final consonants in CVC words embedded in short phrases and simple sentences using a picture story activity (e.g., “I see a cup,” “big cat on mat,” “mom has map”). Compared with last week, he showed slightly improved ability to maintain final consonants within these short phrases, particularly for /p/ and /m/. Final /t/ and /k/ were still less consistent but improving. Some self-correction emerged when he omitted a final sound and heard the clinician’s model.\n\n2. Initial /k/ – phrases and early simple sentences\n- Used play scenes (garage, farm) to elicit initial /k/ in short phrases and simple sentences (e.g., “the car goes,” “cow is big,” “I see a key”). Client produced /k/ more reliably with light verbal cueing and was able to maintain it in some short sentences with repetition. Occasional fronting to /t/ occurred but was less frequent than in earlier sessions.\n\n3. Initial /s/ – CVC words, imitation and emerging phrases\n- Continued focus on initial /s/ in words (sun, sock, soup, sand, soap). Accuracy in imitation showed small but noticeable gains, with more consistent /s/ productions when cued. Briefly trialed initial /s/ in short carrier phrases (e.g., “see sun,” “my sock”) in structured tasks; he could approximate /s/ in some of these phrases with moderate cueing but was not yet consistent.\n\n4.

She reported that daycare staff also commented that they are understanding him more during routines.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient was very engaged and talkative today. He initiated interactions, followed multi-step play routines, and responded well to feedback. He showed clear interest in trying to “fix” his words when given simple cues, indicating increased awareness of his speech.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants (p, t, m, k) – phrase and simple sentence level, increased independence\n- Used a picture-sequencing and storytelling activity to embed CVC words with final consonants into short sentences (e.g., “The cat sits on the mat,” “Mom has a cup,” “Put the map in the bag”). Compared to previous sessions, he demonstrated noticeably higher consistency in producing final /p/ and /m/ and improved accuracy for /t/ and /k/ within these short sentences. He often maintained final consonants without needing direct prompts and occasionally self-corrected when he noticed an omission.\n\n2. Initial /k/ – short sentences and early conversation\n- Practiced initial /k/ in short sentences (“The car is fast,” “The cow eats,” “I can kick”) and then in more natural play-based conversation about cars and animals. He produced /k/ accurately in many imitated and some spontaneous sentences with minimal cueing. Fronting errors were less frequent and, when they occurred, he typically responded to a brief reminder (“back sound”) and corrected himself.\n\n3. Initial /s/ – word and early phrase level\n- Continued with initial /s/ in words (sun, soup, sock, sand, soap, seat) and expanded phrase-level practice (e.g., “see sun,” “soap on,” “sock on”). Accuracy at the word level was meaningfully better than earlier weeks, with more consistent /s/ productions in imitation and some clearer productions in short phrases with visual and verbal cues. Still requires support but is ready for more regular phrase practice.\n\n4. Functional short sentences – generalization\n- Encouraged the client to use short sentences to request, comment, and describe during play (e.g., “I want more,” “My car is stuck,” “Put it in cup”). Intelligibility within these short, familiar sentence frames was noticeably improved, and he seemed proud when others understood him without repetition.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nGiven the marked progress, it is appropriate to continue advancing final consonant and initial /k/ targets into short sentences and structured conversational contexts. For /s/, continue to build consistency at the word level while steadily incorporating short phrases. Parents are encouraged to prompt short sentences at home (e.g., “I want ___,” “I see ___”) and reinforce clear final sounds and initial /k/ when they naturally occur. Next sessions will focus on maintaining these gains and expanding to more spontaneous use in play and conversation."

She noted that he still struggles in fast, excited storytelling, where some end sounds and certain consonants (especially /s/) are less clear. No new concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient was cooperative and interactive. He engaged readily in structured tasks and pretend play, showing good attention for his age. Some increased chattiness led to reduced precision at times, but he responded well when reminded to “use his careful speech.”\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants (p, t, m, k) – short sentences and structured conversation\n- Continued practicing final consonants in short sentence frames and brief, structured conversations about picture scenes (e.g., describing what people have or what animals do). His performance was similar to last week: generally good accuracy in practiced sentences, with occasional omissions when he spoke more quickly. He was often able to correct himself when cued to slow down and “say the end sound.”\n\n2. Initial /k/ – sentence level and play-based conversation\n- Used themed play (cars, cooking) to elicit sentences with initial /k/ (e.g., “The car can go,” “Cook the corn,” “The cat is on the car”). He maintained a strong pattern of accurate /k/ production in these contexts, with only occasional fronting when excited. Minimal verbal cueing was needed compared to earlier in the block.\n\n3. Initial /s/ – word and short phrase level, consolidation\n- Practiced initial /s/ in words and short phrases (sun, soap, sock, sand, “see sun,” “soap on,” “sock on foot”). Accuracy was comparable to last session, with some correct productions and some substitutions or omissions. Visual and verbal cues remained important. Did not significantly expand beyond short phrases today to allow consolidation.\n\n4. Functional sentences – generalization across play\n- Encouraged use of short, functional sentences across different play routines (e.g., “I want the blue car,” “Put it on top,” “That cat is big”). Intelligibility in these contexts was relatively stable compared to last session: improved from early in the block but still variable depending on complexity and speed.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nMaintain current level of difficulty to allow consolidation of skills, particularly for final consonants and initial /s/ at the word and short-phrase level.

No major change from the last several sessions, suggesting this remains a developing target.\n\n4. Functional sentences and short narratives – overall intelligibility\n- Encouraged him to use short sentences to describe actions and retell simple events (e.g., what happened in the picture story, what he did over the weekend). Intelligibility in these short narratives was noticeably better than at the beginning of the therapy block, though still variable depending on length, rate, and the presence of more challenging sounds like /s/.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue to provide therapy to maintain and further refine final consonant and initial /k/ skills at the sentence and conversational level, and to support ongoing development of initial /s/.

            "note_text": "Parent/caregiver report:\n- Mother reported ongoing concerns about speech clarity, especially with unfamiliar listeners. She noted that he often leaves off the ends of words and that /k/ and /g/ are “usually a /t/ or /d/ sound.” No major changes since initial evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client transitioned with mild hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance. Once in the room, he engaged well in floor play and turn-taking games. Attention was variable; he needed frequent redirection back to speech tasks but responded to visual supports and short activities.\n\nGoals / session targets:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, m, t/)\n- Targeted final consonants at the imitated word level in play (e.g., map, mop, moon, mat, hat). Client frequently omitted final consonants in spontaneous productions (e.g., “ma” for “map”) but could add them with direct models and segmenting (\"ma-p\"). Accuracy in imitation was inconsistent; many productions were approximations (reduced volume, distorted, or very soft final sounds). Required frequent verbal reminders to \"keep the sound at the end\" and visual cue of pointing to a picture of the tail of a word.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation using a \"back sound\" cue and mirror. Client could sometimes approximate /k/ after several simultaneous productions with the clinician but often reverted to /t/. In CV syllables (e.g., \"koo, kah\"), productions were mostly /too, tah/. Needed maximal verbal and gestural cues, as well as tactile cue on throat to feel \"quiet back sound.\" Limited success beyond a few clear approximations.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation\n- Introduced /s/ as a \"long quiet sound\" using snake visuals. Client was able to approximate a prolonged airflow sound in isolation with moderate verbal cueing and modeling. However, productions were often short or had added /t/ onset. Did not yet attempt /s/ in syllables.\n\n4. Early syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Observed in play: consistent CV and CVCV (same) syllable shapes (e.g., \"mama,\" \"dada,\" \"baba\"). Some CVC words attempted spontaneously but with frequent final consonant deletion.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to target final consonants in high-interest play activities at the imitated word level.\n- Maintain focus on establishing /k/ and /s/ in isolation before moving to syllables.\n- Home practice: caregiver encouraged to emphasize final sounds in everyday words (e.g., \"up,\" \"in,\" \"out\") using slow, clear models and positive reinforcement for any attempts at final sounds."

No new concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client entered readily and appeared comfortable with clinician. Participated well in table-top games when they were brief and interactive. Some silliness and sound play, but this was redirected into therapeutic practice.\n\nGoals / session targets:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, m, t/)\n- Continued at imitated word level using picture cards and a fishing game. Compared to last week, client showed clearer marking of final consonants when given a segmented model (e.g., \"ma-p\"). He produced several words with more distinct final sounds without needing the segmenting cue after initial practice. Omission of final consonants still frequent in spontaneous play, but emerging ability to self-correct when reminded (e.g., added /p/ after clinician’s cue “listen, did you hear the end?”).\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Notable improvement in ability to produce /k/ in isolation with visual support (mirror and tongue-back cue). Client produced multiple accurate /k/ sounds in a row when focused. In CV syllables (\"ku, ko, ka\"), still frequently fronted to /t/, but there were a few clear /k/ productions with simultaneous models. Needed moderate-to-maximal cues, though fewer repetitions were required compared to previous session.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and early syllables\n- Practiced long /s/ in isolation with snake toy. Client produced a more consistent, continuous airflow and could maintain the sound for longer durations. Trialed CV syllables (\"see, soo\") in imitation; accuracy was variable, with some productions approximating /sh/ or adding a /t/ onset. With verbal cueing to \"keep tongue behind teeth and blow,\" he was able to achieve a few accurate productions.\n\n4. Syllable shape and intelligibility monitoring\n- In play-based language, continued to observe frequent final consonant deletion, but increased willingness to repeat words after a model. Caregiver report and in-session behavior suggest slightly increased awareness of speech clarity.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue with final consonants at the imitated CVC word level, with gradual introduction of simple carrier phrases once accuracy is more consistent.\n- Maintain /k/ and /s/ practice in isolation and simple CV syllables, with focus on reducing fronting and adding consistency.\n- Home practice: caregiver to model slow CVC words (e.g., \"map, mop, hat, home\") and encourage one or two repetitions, praising any attempt to add the ending sound."

She noticed better endings on a few words like \"up\" and \"out.\" She still feels strangers have difficulty understanding him.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client transitioned smoothly and was eager to show toys. Demonstrated good engagement with structured games today and tolerated more practice trials per activity. Short attention lapses but responded well to visual schedules and choice-making.\n\nGoals / session targets:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, m, t, n/)\n- Expanded CVC set and continued at imitated word level, with some practice in simple carrier phrases (\"my ___\"). Client produced final consonants with noticeably increased consistency compared to prior sessions. Many words included a clearly audible final sound after a single model. Occasional omissions remained in spontaneous attempts, but he corrected some of these when given a prompt (\"let's put the sound at the end\"). Beginning to mark endings in short carrier phrases with clinician support.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CV and CVC words\n- Client produced /k/ in CV syllables (\"koo, key, kah\") with more reliable accuracy when using a \"back sound\" cue. Fewer substitutions of /t/ were observed, especially when he watched the clinician in the mirror. Trialed a small set of initial /k/ CVC words (e.g., \"cup, cat, coat\") at the imitated level. Accuracy was emerging; several clear approximations were achieved with moderate cueing, though consistency remains variable.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in CV and CVC words\n- Practiced /s/ in CV syllables and a limited set of CVC words (e.g., \"see, soup, sun\") at the imitated level. Client was able to maintain a continuous /s/ more often and produced some clear initial /s/ in words with visual cueing (showing teeth, finger in front of mouth). Occasional /sh/ substitutions and deletions persisted, but there was a modest increase in correct productions.\n\n4. Early phrase production with target sounds\n- Introduced simple two-word phrases incorporating CVC words (e.g., \"my map,\" \"big hat\") in structured play. Client required modeling of both the phrase structure and target sound, but could imitate short phrases with some final consonants preserved. Phrase-level accuracy was lower than single-word level, though he appeared motivated and willing to try.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen final consonant production in CVC words and gradually increase use in simple carrier phrases.\n- Maintain focus on initial /k/ and /s/ at the imitated word level, with continued support using visual and verbal cues.\n- Home practice: encourage short two-word combinations using practiced CVC words (e.g., \"my cup,\" \"big map\"), emphasizing clear final sounds and praising attempts."

She also mentioned he will sometimes correct himself after she models a word.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client was cheerful and talkative on arrival. Participated well in both table-top and floor-based activities. He tolerated a higher number of practice trials with minimal frustration and enjoyed taking turns giving the clinician \"speech tickets\" for good sounds.\n\nGoals / session targets:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words and short phrases)\n- Continued work with CVC words including /p, m, t, n/ and added some /k/ final words (e.g., \"back, book\"). At the imitated word level, accuracy for final consonants was generally high, with only occasional omissions. Client showed improved carryover into short carrier phrases (\"my book,\" \"big map\"), often maintaining the final sound after one model. Spontaneous speech still showed some final consonant deletion, but he demonstrated more frequent self-corrections when cued.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word level\n- Focused on initial /k/ CVC words in a picture lotto game (e.g., \"car, cat, cup, coat, key\"). Client produced many accurate /k/ productions with moderate cueing and was able to imitate words with less reliance on mirror support than in previous sessions. Fewer /t/ substitutions were observed, and he occasionally produced initial /k/ spontaneously when excited about a picture (e.g., \"car\" during play). Ready to begin practicing /k/ in simple phrases in upcoming sessions.\n\n3. Initial /s/ at word level\n- Targeted initial /s/ in CVC words (\"sun, soap, sock, soup\") at the imitated level. Client produced a mix of correct /s/ and /sh/ or /t/ substitutions. However, he demonstrated clearer /s/ productions when using a visual cue to \"smile and blow\" and when the clinician elongated the sound. Accuracy showed a meaningful increase compared to earlier sessions, though consistency still varied.\n\n4. Two- and three-word phrases with target sounds\n- Practiced short phrases incorporating target words (e.g., \"see sun,\" \"my cup,\" \"big cat\"). With modeling, client was able to imitate many phrases and occasionally maintained both initial and final target sounds. Phrase-level accuracy remains lower than single-word level but is improving as he becomes more familiar with the structure.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Begin to systematically incorporate initial /k/ words into short carrier phrases, while maintaining strong practice at the word level.\n- Continue to support initial /s/ at the imitated word level, focusing on differentiating /s/ from /sh/.\n- Home practice: caregiver to choose 3–4 target CVC words (e.g., \"cup, cat, sun, map\") and practice in simple phrases such as \"my ___\" and \"big ___,\" emphasizing clear starting and ending sounds."

Final consonant production in CVC words and phrases\n- Continued practice with CVC words (including /p, m, t, n, k/) using a board game. Accuracy at the imitated word level remained fairly consistent with last session, with many correct final consonants and occasional omissions. In short carrier phrases (\"my book,\" \"red cup\"), he continued to require modeling and reminders but could maintain some final consonants. Spontaneous speech during play still showed a mix of marked and unmarked endings.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in words and simple phrases\n- Practiced initial /k/ CVC words in a picture-matching activity, then moved into simple phrases (\"my car,\" \"blue cup\") with models. Client produced initial /k/ with moderate cueing and showed similar accuracy to the previous session. He sometimes reverted to /t/ in connected speech but responded to verbal cueing (\"back sound\"). Phrase-level productions were emerging but not yet consistent.\n\n3. Initial /s/ at word level\n- Targeted initial /s/ CVC words (\"sun, soup, sock, soap\") in a turn-taking card game. Accuracy remained variable; client produced several clear /s/ sounds when given a slow model and visual cue, but also had frequent /sh/ substitutions.

Needed extra encouragement at the start of structured tasks but warmed up with a familiar game. Occasional off-topic comments, but he was easily redirected.\n\nGoals / session targets:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words and short phrases\n- Practiced final consonants in a variety of CVC words during a race game. Accuracy at the imitated word level was similar to previous sessions: many correct productions with occasional omissions or reduced volume on final sounds. In short phrases, he continued to require models and cueing to maintain endings. Overall performance suggests ongoing consolidation rather than significant change.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in words and phrases\n- Continued work on initial /k/ words (\"cup, car, cat, coat\") and short phrases (\"my car,\" \"big cup\"). Client produced /k/ with moderate cueing.

            "note_text": "Parent report:\n- Caregiver shared that child is starting junior kindergarten in the fall and that unfamiliar listeners often have difficulty understanding him.\n- No major changes since the initial assessment; family notices that he sometimes leaves sounds off the ends of words (e.g., “boo” for “book”).\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with some initial hesitation but joined the clinician after a brief warm-up game.\n- Engaged best with hands-on toys and short turn-taking games; needed frequent reminders to stay at the table and participate in structured tasks.\n- Responded well to specific praise and visual reinforcement (stickers, picture cards).\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Establish production of /k/ and /g/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Focused on /k/ in isolation using mouth pictures and a “back sound” cue. Child could approximate /k/ with maximal verbal and visual cueing in a few attempts, but often substituted /t/.\n- Introduced simple CV syllables with /k/ (e.g., “koo,” “kee”); accuracy was low, with most productions sounding more like /t/.\n- Briefly trialed /g/ in isolation; child had difficulty coordinating the movement and required hand-over-hand cues for jaw stabilization.\n\n2. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, m/)\n- Practiced final /p/ in CVC words in imitation (e.g., “up,” “cup,” “hop”). Child frequently omitted the final sound or added a vowel (e.g., “uh-puh”).\n- With maximal cues (visual, tapping the table for the last sound), child produced clearer final /p/ in a few trials but was not yet consistent.\n- Final /m/ in short words (“ham,” “mom”) was sometimes present in spontaneous play but often reduced or nasalized without a clear closure.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Introduced /f/ as a “quiet lip-biting air sound.” Child was able to imitate the airflow with visual modeling but frequently added a stop (e.g., “fp”).\n- Practiced CV syllables (e.g., “foo,” “fee”); productions were effortful and required continuous cues to “bite lip and blow.”\n\n4. Early two-word combinations during play\n- Encouraged simple two-word phrases (e.g., “more bubbles,” “my turn”) during familiar routines.\n- Child primarily used single words or jargon; required direct models and hand-over-hand signs to attempt two-word combinations.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build awareness of back sounds /k, g/ and final consonants at the isolation and simple word levels.\n- Provide caregivers with demonstration of “back sound” cue and final consonant tapping strategy for short practice at home using 3–5 familiar words.\n- Next session, plan to further stabilize /k/ in isolation/CV syllables and re-check final consonants with more structured play contexts."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\n- Caregiver reported that child has been more chatty at home but speech is still “a bit mushy” for others.\n- Family tried some “back sound” practice; caregiver noted that he can sometimes make a stronger /k/ sound when very focused.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated from caregiver with minimal prompting today and appeared excited to show the clinician a toy car.\n- Attention to table tasks improved compared to last week; remained seated for short activities with occasional redirection.\n- Responded positively to turn-taking games and verbal praise.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Reviewed /k/ in isolation using visual models and a tongue-back cue. Child produced clearer /k/ in several attempts with moderate verbal and visual cues.\n- Practiced CV syllables (“kee, koo, kah”); accuracy was higher than last session when imitating directly after the model, though still inconsistent.\n- Noted a few spontaneous approximations of /k/ during play (e.g., “car”) with partial backing but reduced clarity.\n\n2. Final consonants in CVC words (/p, m/)\n- Targeted final /p/ in imitation using picture cards (“cup, up, nap”). With moderate cues (tapping for the last sound, slowed rate), child produced more audible final consonants in several trials.\n- Final /m/ in words like “ham,” “mom,” “room” showed emerging accuracy; still occasional omission or vowel prolongation.\n- Overall, slightly more consistent marking of final consonants compared to baseline, though still requiring high levels of cueing.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in CV syllables and simple words\n- Practiced /f/ in CV syllables (“fee, foo”) with visual mirror support. Child demonstrated more reliable airflow with lip-biting but continued to insert an extra sound at times.\n- Introduced a small set of words (“fish, four, fun”) at the imitated word level. Productions were often approximations but closer to target than prior session.\n\n4. Two-word combinations in play routines\n- Modeled and elicited two-word phrases (“more bubbles,” “go car,” “my turn”) during structured play.\n- Child imitated several 2-word combinations with clinician models; spontaneous use was limited but there were more attempts than last week.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on /k/ CV syllables and CVC words with final /p, m/, aiming for increased consistency with moderate cues.\n- Encourage caregivers to practice 3–5 /k/ and final consonant words daily, keeping practice short and playful.\n- Next session, consider trialing simple /k/ words in play if current level remains consistent or improves."

Accuracy was noticeably higher than previous sessions, with several clear productions in a row.\n- Occasional fronting to /t/ persisted, but child responded to visual cueing (pointing to throat/back of mouth) and could self-correct when prompted.\n\n2. Final consonants in CVC words (/p, m/; introduction of /t/)\n- Final /p/ in CVC words (“cup, up, hop”) produced more consistently with moderate cues. Child began to anticipate the last sound when clinician tapped the table.\n- Final /m/ words (“ham, mom, room”) showed better closure and resonance; omissions were less frequent.\n- Introduced final /t/ in a small set of words (e.g., “hat, hot”). Child often omitted /t/ but could mark it in some trials with explicit slow speech and tapping.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in simple words\n- Continued work on /f/ in words (“fish, four, fun, feet”). Child was able to produce a clearer /f/ at the beginning of some words with visual support in the mirror.\n- Still showed occasional stopping or cluster-like productions (e.g., “fpish”), but overall approximations were closer to target.\n\n4. Two- and three-word phrases in structured play\n- Encouraged short phrases (e.g., “go fast car,” “more bubbles please”) with verbal models.\n- Child imitated several 2–3 word phrases accurately; spontaneous combinations were emerging, though still shorter and less clear.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Given progress, continue building consistency at initial /k/ word level and expand the word list.\n- Maintain work on final consonants, especially /p, m, t/, using tapping cues.\n- Provide caregiver with a short list of /k/ and final consonant words to practice in play (e.g., bath, snack time).\n- Next session, consider probing /k/ in short carrier phrases if word-level accuracy remains strong."

Final consonants: /p, m, t/ in CVC words\n- Continued work on final /p/ and /m/ using picture cards and play routines. Child more consistently marked the final consonant when given a slow rate and tapping cue.\n- Final /t/ remained more challenging; omissions were common, but child produced a clearer /t/ in some high-interest words (e.g., “hat”) with maximal cueing.\n- Overall, there was a modest increase in consistency compared to previous session.\n\n3. Initial /f/ words and syllables\n- Practiced /f/ in isolation and in CV syllables as a warm-up, then moved into words (“fish, feet, fun, four”).\n- Child showed slightly better control over airflow and lip placement, though still required frequent reminders.\n- A few spontaneous approximations of /f/ were observed in play (e.g., “food”), though not consistently accurate.\n\n4. Two- and three-word phrases in play\n- Modeled short functional phrases (“my turn,” “go fast car,” “more bubbles”) and encouraged child to imitate.\n- Child imitated several phrases and occasionally combined 2–3 words independently, though speech clarity varied.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating /k/ at word level and short phrases; maintain strong emphasis on final consonants.\n- Provide caregiver with simple phrase frames containing /k/ words (e.g., “my car,” “big cat”) for home practice.\n- Next session, plan to further strengthen final /t/ and re-check /f/ in a slightly larger variety of words."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\n- Mother brought client to session and reported that speech \"still sounds a bit blurry\" to unfamiliar listeners. She notices some clearer words when he is very excited about a toy. No concerns with hearing or general health this week.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client transitioned into the therapy room with mild hesitation but separated from mom with encouragement. Once in the room, he was curious and engaged with toys. Attention to adult-directed tasks was variable; he preferred self-directed play and needed frequent gentle redirection. Accepted visual schedule and simple choices.\n\nGoals/targets this session:\n1) Establish baseline for speech sound production\n- During play-based interaction, overall intelligibility to the clinician was reduced in connected speech. Frequent omission of final consonants (e.g., \"ki\" for \"kick,\" \"do\" for \"dog\"), and inconsistent marking of consonant blends (\"top\" for \"stop,\" \"pider\" for \"spider\").\n- Syllable shapes observed: strong use of CV and CVCV patterns; CVC and CCVC forms were less consistent.\n\n2) Initial /f/ at isolation and syllable level\n- Introduced /f/ as a \"quiet lip bite air\" sound. In isolation with visual model and mirror, client approximated /f/ in about half of attempts; often substituted /p/ or produced only airflow without lip contact.\n- In CV syllables (\"foo,\" \"faa\"), accuracy was low; productions frequently shifted to /p/ (\"poo\"). Maximal verbal and visual cues required.\n\n3) Initial /s/ at isolation level\n- Client demonstrated awareness of /s/ when modeled, occasionally labeling it as a \"snake\" sound. In isolation, /s/ often produced as /d/ or lateralized with extra airflow.\n- With mirror and slowed modeling, he produced a recognizable /s/ in some attempts, but could not yet maintain consistency. Required maximal verbal cueing and some tactile cueing (finger to sides of mouth) to shape airflow.\n\n4) Final consonant production (general)\n- Probed final /p, m, t/ in CVC words (\"map,\" \"cat,\" \"cup\") in imitation. Client omitted final consonants in most attempts. When provided with segmented modeling and tapping for each sound, he could add a final consonant occasionally but not reliably.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build rapport and establish routine.\n- Next session: continue shaping /f/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables; continue probing final consonants.\n- Home practice: caregiver encouraged to model slow, clear productions of target words during daily routines (e.g., \"feet,\" \"soap,\" \"cup\") without pressure for the child to imitate; praise any clear attempts. No formal homework sheet provided today."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\n- Mother reported no major changes since last week. She notices he is \"trying more words\" and sometimes repeats after older sibling. Still difficult for extended family to understand him on the phone.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client entered therapy room more readily today, with only brief checking back to mom. Participated well in turn-taking games and tolerated short periods of structured drill embedded in play. Needed occasional breaks but returned to tasks with simple reminders.\n\nGoals/targets this session:\n1) Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Reviewed \"quiet lip bite air\" cue with mirror. Client produced /f/ in isolation with improved consistency compared to last session when given a visual model; still occasionally substituted /p/ but showed more accurate airflow.\n- In CV syllables (\"fee,\" \"foo,\" \"fa\"), accuracy increased with simultaneous production and slow pacing; about half were clear when closely supported. Continued to require moderate verbal and visual cues, but fewer tactile cues needed.\n\n2) Initial /s/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Practiced /s/ with \"snake\" imagery and visual mouth model. Client was able to imitate a clearer /s/ sound more frequently today when cued to \"keep tongue behind teeth\" and \"blow gently.\"\n- In CV syllables (\"see,\" \"soo\"), he approximated /s/ with emerging consistency. Some productions remained distorted or shifted to /d/, but there were more recognizable /s/ sounds than last week.\n\n3) Final consonants /p, m, t/ at imitated CVC word level\n- Target words included \"map,\" \"cup,\" \"cat,\" \"ham.\" When provided with segmented models and tapping each sound, client marked the final consonant in a higher proportion of trials than baseline, although still inconsistently.\n- He responded well to visual cue of \"closing the word\" with a fist when adding the final sound.\n\n4) Functional word attempts in play\n- Encouraged client to imitate simple functional words and short 2-word phrases during play (e.g., \"my turn,\" \"more bubbles,\" \"big car\"). He imitated several 2-word combinations with reduced clarity but increasing willingness to attempt.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue current targets with focus on consolidating /f/ and /s/ at isolation and simple syllable level.\n- Next session: consider introducing a small set of /f/ and /s/ initial words in imitation if consistency remains at this level.\n- Home practice: caregiver to continue modeling target sounds in daily routines; provided ideas such as \"fish,\" \"feet,\" \"sun,\" \"soap\" during bath time and play. Emphasized keeping practice brief and playful."

She feels he is \"a bit clearer\" with a few favorite words.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client separated smoothly from caregiver and quickly engaged with toys. Demonstrated good participation in structured activities when they were embedded in a game format. Attention span appropriate for age with brief redirections.\n\nGoals/targets this session:\n1) Initial /f/ at word level (imitation)\n- Moved from syllables to simple initial /f/ words (\"fish,\" \"fan,\" \"feet,\" \"food,\" \"fun\"). Client imitated these with noticeably higher accuracy than in prior sessions when provided with verbal and visual cues.\n- He often self-corrected after an initial /p/ production when reminded to \"bite lip and blow,\" suggesting growing awareness. Accuracy was high in supported imitation, though he still required cueing to maintain.\n\n2) Initial /s/ at word level (imitation)\n- Target words included \"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"soap,\" \"see.\" With modeling and \"snake\" cueing, client produced more consistent /s/ in the initial position.\n- Some substitutions (/d/ for /s/) persisted, but he responded well to slower pacing and mirror feedback. Overall performance represented a meaningful step up from isolation-level work.\n\n3) Final consonants /p, m, t/ at CVC word level (imitation)\n- Continued work on words such as \"map,\" \"cup,\" \"ham,\" \"cat,\" \"hat.\" Client marked final consonants more reliably today, especially when using segmented models and tapping.\n- He was able to add or correct a missing final sound in several trials after a prompt (\"close the word\"), showing increased responsiveness to feedback.\n\n4) Functional 2-word phrases in play with clearer key words\n- During play, encouraged phrases like \"my fish,\" \"sun up,\" \"big cup.\" Client imitated 2-word combinations with variable intelligibility but more recognizable target sounds when the initial /f/ or /s/ word had just been practiced.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to practice initial /f/ and /s/ at the imitated word level; begin to expand the word list as tolerated.\n- Next session: trial simple carrier phrases with initial /f/ or /s/ words (e.g., \"my fish,\" \"see ___\") if accuracy remains strong in imitation.\n- Home practice: provided caregiver with a short list of /f/ and /s/ words used in session and encouraged 3–5 minutes of playful practice once per day, focusing on accuracy rather than speed."

She feels these words are much easier to understand. No new concerns reported.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client arrived in a cheerful mood and transitioned independently. He remained engaged throughout the session with minimal redirection. Enjoyed using stickers and a spinner game as part of practice and responded well to praise.\n\nGoals/targets this session:\n1) Initial /f/ words in imitation and emerging carrier phrases\n- Reviewed initial /f/ words (\"fish,\" \"feet,\" \"fun,\" \"food,\" \"four\"). Accuracy in imitation remained strong with only light verbal cues.\n- Introduced short carrier phrases (\"my fish,\" \"more food,\" \"four fish\") in imitation. Client was able to maintain the /f/ target in many attempts, though overall phrase clarity varied.\n\n2) Initial /s/ words in imitation and limited spontaneous use\n- Practiced initial /s/ words (\"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"soap,\" \"see\"). Accuracy in imitation showed slight improvement compared to last week, with fewer /d/ substitutions.\n- In play, client occasionally produced an initial /s/ word spontaneously after recent practice (e.g., \"sock\" while dressing a doll). These were not yet consistent but indicated emerging carryover.\n\n3) Final consonants /p, m, t/ at CVC word level\n- Continued work with CVC words (\"map,\" \"cup,\" \"ham,\" \"hat,\" \"hot\"). Client maintained similar performance to last session, with several accurate final consonants when cued and some omissions when attention decreased.\n- He benefited from visual cues and slowing the word down; still required moderate cueing to consistently mark final sounds.\n\n4) Early /s/ blends – awareness only\n- Briefly introduced /s/ blends in a play context (e.g., \"stop,\" \"spin\") to gauge readiness. Client often reduced the blend (\"top,\" \"pin\") but was able to hear the difference when the clinician contrasted pairs.\n- No formal goal shift yet; this served as an initial exposure activity.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating initial /f/ and /s/ at word level and short carrier phrases, with emphasis on consistency.\n- Maintain focus on final consonants; consider adding visual supports (picture cards with dots for each sound).\n- Home practice: caregiver encouraged to model and gently elicit short /f/ phrases (\"my feet,\" \"fun fish\") during daily routines; continue praising any clear /s/ attempts without over-correcting."

She notices some \"better s\" sounds occasionally, though they are still inconsistent. She feels overall he is \"slowly getting clearer.\"\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client was cooperative and enthusiastic, quickly joining tabletop and floor-based activities. Demonstrated good turn-taking and tolerated brief drill segments embedded in games. Mild silliness at times but easily redirected with visual cues.\n\nGoals/targets this session:\n1) Initial /f/ in short phrases and early sentence attempts\n- Continued practice with carrier phrases (\"my fish,\" \"more food,\" \"four feet\") and expanded to simple 3–4 word sentences in imitation (\"I see fish,\" \"I want food\").\n- Client maintained good accuracy for initial /f/ within these phrases when given a model and light verbal cues. Occasional reductions in clarity were more related to rate and other sounds than to /f/ itself.\n\n2) Initial /s/ at word and emerging phrase level\n- Reviewed initial /s/ words and introduced short phrases (\"my sock,\" \"see sun\"). Accuracy at the single-word imitated level continued to show gradual improvement, with fewer /d/ substitutions and more consistent airflow.\n- In short phrases, client sometimes maintained the /s/ target but tended to simplify or reduce other parts of the phrase. Still required moderate verbal and visual cues.\n\n3) Final consonants /p, m, t/ at CVC word level\n- Practiced final consonants in a picture game with words such as \"cup,\" \"map,\" \"ham,\" \"cat,\" \"hat.\" Performance appeared similar to prior session: some clearly marked final consonants when he was focused, with frequent omissions as tasks became more automatic.\n- Continued benefit from segmented models and the \"close the word\" cue.\n\n4) Awareness of /s/ blends\n- Revisited /s/ blends in a listening activity (e.g., \"stop\" vs. \"top,\" \"star\" vs. \"tar\"). Client could usually identify which word the clinician said when given choices, but his own productions continued to reduce the cluster.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain current focus: stabilize /f/ in short phrases/sentences and continue improving /s/ accuracy at the word and short phrase level.\n- Keep targeting final consonants in CVC words; not yet ready to move to more complex word shapes.\n- Home practice: suggested a short daily game where caregiver labels and has child repeat a few /s/ and /f/ words, emphasizing slow, clear speech. Encouraged parent to continue noticing and praising any final consonant productions."

Needed a few more short breaks but returned to tasks with encouragement.\n\nGoals/targets this session:\n1) Initial /f/ in short phrases/sentences\n- Continued with 3–4 word sentences in imitation (\"I see fish,\" \"I want four fish,\" \"my feet are wet\"). Client maintained good accuracy for initial /f\" in these contexts with minimal cueing.\n- Occasional reductions in overall intelligibility were due to other sounds and fast rate rather than /f/ specifically. Performance was generally stable compared to last week.\n\n2) Initial /s/ at word and short phrase level\n- Practiced imitated initial /s/ words and simple phrases (\"see sun,\" \"my sock,\" \"soap here\"). Accuracy remained similar to the previous session: more consistent /s/ than in earlier weeks, but still some /d/ substitutions and distortions when attention waned.\n- Continued to need moderate verbal and visual cueing for best productions.\n\n3) Final consonants /p, m, t/ at CVC level\n- Used a board game format with picture cards (\"cup,\" \"map,\" \"ham,\" \"cat,\" \"hot\"). Client showed a comparable pattern to prior sessions: able to mark final consonants in some trials, especially when prompted to slow down and tap out sounds, but omitted them in many spontaneous attempts.\n\n4) Listening for /s/ blends\n- Brief listening activity contrasting /s/ blends vs. single consonant (\"stop/top,\" \"snow/no\"). Client correctly identified the clinician's productions in many cases, indicating stable awareness, but his own productions remained reduced.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating skills at current levels; no major changes to targets this week.\n- Next session: reassess readiness to increase complexity for /s/ if consistency improves.\n- Home practice: encouraged caregiver to keep daily practice short given his fatigue this week; continue playful repetition of /s/ and /f/ words and to slow down speech when reading books together, highlighting final consonants."

He engaged well with structured activities when they were game-based and responded positively to praise and token rewards. Attention was generally good with occasional brief redirections.\n\nGoals/targets this session:\n1) Initial /f/ in sentences and semi-structured play\n- Used picture scenes and simple story prompts to elicit sentences with initial /f/ words (\"The fish is big,\" \"I feed the fish\").

She feels familiar listeners understand him more easily now, though he still needs support for certain words.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client transitioned easily and was eager to participate. Demonstrated good attention and motivation throughout the session, especially when activities were game-like. Responded well to specific feedback about his sounds.\n\nGoals/targets this session:\n1) Initial /f/ – maintenance in conversation\n- Monitored /f/ across a variety of conversational topics and play routines. Client consistently produced initial /f/ correctly in spontaneous speech without needing cues.\n- /f/ continues to be a clear strength area with stable performance.\n\n2) Initial /s/ at word and short phrase level\n- Targeted initial /s/ in a range of words (\"sun,\" \"sand,\" \"soap,\" \"sit,\" \"see\") and then in 2–3 word phrases (\"see sun,\" \"my soap,\" \"sit down\"). Accuracy remained similar to recent sessions: multiple clear /s/ productions at the word level, with some ongoing substitutions or distortions.\n- In short phrases, he was able to maintain the /s/ sound in some attempts when given a model and cues to use his \"snake sound\" and speak slowly. Overall, this reflects continued consolidation at this level rather than a new jump in performance.\n\n3) Final consonants /p, m, t/ in CVC words\n- Practiced CVC words (\"cup,\" \"map,\" \"ham,\" \"cat,\" \"hat\") using a turn-taking game. Client produced a combination of accurate and omitted final consonants, similar to prior sessions. When prompted to tap out the sounds and \"close the word,\" he could add or correct final consonants in many supported trials.\n\n4) /s/ blends – high-support attempts\n- Briefly revisited /s/ blends (\"stop,\" \"spin,\" \"snow\") in slow imitation with visual cueing (two dots for two consonants). Client produced a small number of approximate blends but generally continued to reduce clusters in more natural speech.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue focusing intervention on improving consistency of initial /s/ at the phrase level and strengthening final consonant production before moving more fully into /s/ blends.\n- Consider updating goals in the next treatment block to reflect progress with /f/ (maintenance goal) and to further refine /s/ and final consonant targets.\n- Home practice: encouraged caregiver to keep practicing a small set of /s/ words and short phrases daily and to continue highlighting final consonants in CVC words in a playful, low-pressure way."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\n- Caregiver reported that speech is often difficult for unfamiliar listeners to understand, especially in longer words and when excited.\n- Noted that child “drops sounds” at the ends of words and often says “tup” for “cup,” “do” for “go.”\n- No concerns about hearing or health since intake.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with some initial hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance.\n- Once engaged in play, child was cheerful and interactive, with frequent vocalizations and attempts to communicate.\n- Attention to adult-directed tasks was variable; needed frequent redirection from self-directed play back to speech activities.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Establish baseline for speech sound production\n- Informal play-based speech sample collected during activities with cars, a farm set, and a picture book.\n- Noted frequent final consonant deletion (e.g., “pi_” for “pig,” “ca_” for “cat”) and reduction of consonant clusters (e.g., “pane” for “plane,” “top” for “stop”).\n- Fronting of /k, g/ to /t, d/ observed in initial and medial positions (e.g., “tar” for “car,” “doe” for “go”).\n- Intelligibility to clinician estimated at ~50–60% in connected speech without context.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and simple syllables (new)\n- Introduced “back sound” /k/ using mouth model and mirror.\n- In isolation, child approximated /k/ in ~3/10 trials with maximal verbal and visual cues (open wide, tongue back), often substituting /t/.\n- In CV syllables with vowel /a/ (e.g., “ka”), productions were mostly /ta/ despite hand cues; accurate productions were inconsistent.\n\n3. Final consonant awareness (CVC words)\n- Used minimal pairs and picture cards (e.g., “bee/beep,” “bow/boat”) to highlight the “sound at the end.”\n- Child could point to the correct picture when clinician emphasized the final sound in ~6/10 trials.\n- Attempts to add final consonants in imitation were limited; productions often omitted the final sound despite maximal modeling.\n\n4. Early two- and three-word phrases for functional communication\n- During play, child used many single words and some 2-word combinations (e.g., “my car,” “more bubbles”).\n- With modeling and gestures, child imitated 3-word phrases such as “I want car,” “more big bubbles” in ~7/10 opportunities.\n- Spontaneous 3-word phrases were rare but emerging when highly motivated.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build awareness of “back sound” /k/ in isolation and simple syllables next session.\n- Maintain focus on hearing/marking final consonants in short CVC words through listening games.\n- Home practice: caregiver encouraged to model slow, clear words with final sounds (e.g., “cup,” “dog,” “boat”), emphasizing the last sound without asking for repeated corrections; praise any attempts to “finish” words.\n- Monitor tolerance for structured tasks; continue to embed practice into play-based activities."

Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Reviewed /k/ in isolation using mirror and “back sound” imagery.\n- Child produced a clearer /k/ in isolation in approximately 5/10 attempts with maximal verbal and visual cues (improved from prior session).\n- In CV syllables (e.g., “ka,” “koo”), child produced approximations in ~4/10 trials; remaining attempts were /t/ substitutions.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word level (imitated)\n- Introduced simple /k/ initial words (e.g., “car,” “cow,” “key”) in imitation.\n- Accuracy was low but emerging; child produced recognizable /k/ at the start in about 3/10 trials with heavy cueing (open mouth, tongue back, slow rate).\n- Remaining productions were mostly fronted (/tar/ for “car,” /tee/ for “key”).\n\n3. Final consonant awareness in CVC words\n- Continued minimal pair listening tasks (“bow/boat,” “bee/beep,” “see/seat”).\n- Child correctly identified the “finished” word vs. the “unfinished” word in ~7/10 opportunities, showing slightly better discrimination.\n- When imitating CVC words, final consonants were still frequently omitted; occasional accurate productions in high-interest words (e.g., “pop”) with maximal cues.\n\n4. Functional 2–3 word phrases\n- Child spontaneously used multiple 2-word phrases (“more bubbles,” “my turn,” “big truck”).\n- With modeling, child imitated 3-word requests (e.g., “I want bubbles,” “more big blocks”) in ~8/10 opportunities.\n- Needed verbal prompts to expand beyond single words, but willingness to imitate was good.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue direct instruction for initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables; maintain word-level practice in a small set of familiar words.\n- Keep working on listening and awareness of final consonants with simple minimal pairs.\n- Home practice: encourage caregiver to use a mirror to show “tongue back” for /k/, practicing a few fun words (e.g., “car,” “cow”) once or twice per day in a playful way; continue modeling full CVC words with clear final sounds without pressuring for perfect imitation."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\n- Mother reported that she and client’s grandmother both notice that he is “hard to understand” when he is excited or talking fast. She noted that he often leaves off the ends of words and that /s/ and /f/ are particularly tricky. No major changes since the evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client transitioned to the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from mother without tears. He warmed up quickly with preferred cars and animal toys. Attention to adult-directed tasks was fair; he needed occasional redirection from self-directed play back to speech activities. Participated well with visual supports and short, play-based tasks.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words)\n- Targeted final /p/ and /t/ in simple CVC words (e.g., “cup, up, hat, hot”) in imitation. Client frequently omitted final consonants (“cu,” “ha”). With simultaneous production and direct modeling, he produced final consonants clearly in about half of opportunities. Required frequent visual cues (pointing to mouth, tapping picture for the “end sound”) and slowed rate.\n\n2. Initial /f/ at syllable and word level\n- Practiced /f/ in isolation (“ffff”) and in simple syllables (“fuh, foo”). Client could approximate /f/ with moderate verbal cues to “bite your lip and blow,” but often substituted /p/ or /b/. At the word level (e.g., “fish, four, foot”), accuracy was low; productions were often “pish, bor.” Heavy modeling and mirror work used; client responded well to watching the clinician’s mouth.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Introduced /s/ in isolation using “snake sound” imagery. Client produced a prolonged /s/ sound with air mostly through the center of the tongue in some attempts, but often distorted to /th/ or stopped to /t/. At the syllable level (“see, soo”), accuracy was inconsistent even with maximal cues and models. Used gestural cue (finger in front of mouth like a snake) with some success.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Observed spontaneous productions in play (e.g., “mama, baby, go car”). Client produced a variety of CV and CVCV (reduplicated) shapes. In imitation tasks with picture cards, he could imitate most CV and CVCV forms, but often simplified CVC to CV.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to target final consonants in high-interest CVC words and build consistency at the imitated word level.\n- Continue to establish /f/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables before moving to more complex words.\n- Suggested home practice: parent to model and emphasize end sounds in everyday words (e.g., “cup,” “bed”) and practice “snake sound” /s/ in a mirror for short periods during play."

She has noticed a “few clearer words,” especially “cup” and “up,” when he is focused. She still finds him difficult to understand in longer sentences.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client entered the room willingly and quickly engaged with a car ramp activity. Overall participation was improved; he remained at the table for short tasks when activities were rotated frequently. Occasional silliness but easily redirected with clear expectations.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words (p, t, m)\n- Revisited final /p/, /t/, and added /m/ in CVC words (e.g., “cup, hat, ham, home”). In imitation with visual cueing (tapping the final sound on the picture), client produced final consonants with noticeably higher consistency than last week. Many words produced with a clear final sound, though sometimes released with an extra vowel (“cup-uh”). Emerging ability to self-correct when provided with a second model.\n\n2. Initial /f/ at syllable and word level\n- Practiced /f/ in isolation, CV syllables, and high-interest words (“fish, food, fun”). Client was able to sustain /f/ in isolation more consistently today, especially when looking in a mirror and following the cue “bite lip, blow air.” At the word level, approximations frequently still began with /p/ or /h/, but there were several accurate or near-accurate productions with moderate cues. Improvement noted in his willingness to attempt multiple repetitions.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple words\n- Continued work on /s/ in isolation and in a small set of words (“sun, soup, sock”). Client produced a clearer /s/ in isolation more often today using the “snake sound” cue. At the word level, errors remained (e.g., “tun” for “sun,” “thock” for “sock”), but he was beginning to differentiate the target sound from /t/ when provided with auditory discrimination tasks. Needed maximal verbal and visual prompts to approximate /s/ in initial position.\n\n4. Functional phrase attempts\n- During play, encouraged simple two- and three-word phrases (e.g., “more cars,” “big truck”). Client imitated short phrases in many opportunities but often reduced or blurred final consonants. Intelligibility improved slightly when he slowed his rate with clinician modeling.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue at the imitated CVC word level for final consonants, aiming for more consistent, closed syllables.\n- Maintain focus on shaping /f/ and /s/ in isolation and word-initial position with intensive modeling.\n- Home practice: parent to play simple “sound games” focusing on final sounds (e.g., “I spy something that ends with /p/”) and to continue mirror practice for /f/ and /s/ a few minutes daily."

She noted that /f/ words are still very hard for him, but she did hear “fish” once during bath time. No concerns about hearing or general health.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client transitioned smoothly and seemed eager to show the clinician a toy car from home. He was talkative and engaged in play-based tasks. Tolerated structured practice interspersed with play, with good response to visual schedules and brief movement breaks.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words (p, t, m, n)\n- Expanded set of CVC targets (e.g., “cup, hat, ham, sun, moon, man”). In imitated word-level tasks, client produced final consonants with much greater consistency than previous sessions. Final /p/ and /t/ were usually present, though sometimes slightly aspirated or followed by a schwa. Final /m/ and /n/ were mostly accurate in imitation. Occasional spontaneous use of final consonants noted in play (e.g., “hat” while dressing a doll) without direct prompting.\n\n2. Initial /f/ at word level\n- Continued work on /f/ in words such as “fish, food, four, fun.” Client showed a noticeable increase in accurate or close approximations when imitating, especially when given a verbal cue (“lip bite”) plus a gesture. Substitution of /p/ occurred less frequently. Able to maintain /f/ at the beginning of the word in several consecutive trials for “fish” and “four.” Still required moderate cueing, but overall accuracy and confidence improved.\n\n3. Initial /s/ at word level\n- Targeted /s/ in a limited word set (“sun, soup, sock, seal”) using picture cards and a “snake sound” story. Client produced /s/ in isolation with good quality most of the time. At the imitated word level, he produced initial /s/ correctly or with mild distortion in many trials, though some productions remained /t/ or /th/ substitutions. Benefited from slower rate and models with exaggerated /s/ onset.\n\n4. Early /s/ blends – awareness\n- Briefly introduced /s/ blends (e.g., “snow, star, spoon”) at an awareness level only. Client listened and attempted to identify whether he heard “no” vs. “snow.” He could sometimes distinguish the presence of /s/ in minimal pairs but was not yet ready to consistently produce blends.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- For next sessions, continue strengthening final consonants; consider moving some well-established CVC words toward short carrier phrases (e.g., “my hat”).\n- Continue to consolidate initial /f/ and /s/ in a small set of high-frequency words.\n- Home practice: encourage use of clear final sounds in familiar words during routines (bath, mealtimes). Provide parent with picture cards for “fish, four, fun” and “sun, sock” to practice short, positive drill-play bursts."

Family members are starting to understand him more often without her repeating. She has been using the picture cards and feels he enjoys practicing “fish” and “sun.”\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client arrived cheerful and ran into the room independently. He was highly engaged in turn-taking games and accepted structured tasks readily when they were tied to a game (e.g., earning cars for correct productions). Attention was good with minimal redirection needed.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words – transition to carrier phrases\n- Practiced familiar CVC words (e.g., “hat, cup, moon, sun”) first in imitation, then in short carrier phrases such as “my hat,” “in cup,” “big sun.” At the word level, final consonants were generally present and clear. In short phrases, he maintained final consonants in many attempts, though there were occasional omissions when the phrase was longer or faster. Benefited from pacing cues and pausing slightly before the final sound.\n\n2. Initial /f/ – increased independence\n- Continued with /f/ words (“fish, four, fun, food, feet”). Client produced /f/ accurately in most imitated words with only light verbal reminders. When cuing was faded, he was able to produce several correct /f/ words independently, especially in single-word naming tasks. Some reversion to /p/ occurred in spontaneous play, but he responded well to gentle reminders and self-corrected in a few instances.\n\n3. Initial /s/ – word and simple phrase level\n- Worked on /s/ initial words (“sun, sock, soup, seal”) and began short phrases (e.g., “sun up,” “sock on”). Client showed increased consistency with initial /s/ in imitation, with fewer /t/ substitutions. In short phrases, he often preserved the /s/ when the phrase was rehearsed and slowed down. Needed moderate visual cues when phrases were novel or when excited.\n\n4. Early /s/ blends – imitated word level\n- Introduced a small set of /s/ blends at the imitated word level (e.g., “star, spoon, slide”). Client was able to imitate some blends but tended to omit the /s/ (“tar, poon, lide”) or simplify the cluster. With backward chaining (e.g., “tar” → “star”) and hand cueing, he produced a few accurate blends, showing readiness to begin structured practice at this level.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen final consonants within short phrases and monitor consistency across activities.\n- Expand the set of /f/ and /s/ words and continue to fade cues as tolerated.\n- Begin regular, structured practice of a small number of /s/ blends using backward chaining.\n- Home practice: parent to model short phrases with final consonants (e.g., “big cup,” “my hat”) and encourage slow, clear speech; send home a simple /s/ blend game with “star” and “spoon.”"

Occasional omissions or weakening of final consonants were observed when phrases were longer or less familiar. Overall, performance showed slightly increased stability compared to last session, with fewer reminders needed.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in words and emerging phrases\n- Targeted /f/ words (“fish, four, fun, feet, food”) in single-word naming and simple phrases (“four fish,” “fun food”). In imitation, /f/ was generally accurate with brief reminders. When moving into short phrases, he sometimes reduced /f/ to /p/ or omitted it, especially in the second word. With repetition and slower rate, accuracy improved. Independence is gradually emerging but still variable in connected speech.\n\n3.

He participated well in both play-based and table-top tasks, especially when games involved turn-taking and earning small rewards. Attention was good overall with occasional prompts to stay seated.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final consonants in phrases and early sentences\n- Practiced familiar CVC words in short phrases and early sentence structures (e.g., “I see a cup,” “my big hat,” “I see moon”).

He engaged readily in picture-based games and imaginative play. Participation in structured drills was good, especially when targets were embedded in a simple story. Mild fatigue near the end but remained cooperative.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final consonants in short sentences\n- Continued practice of final consonants in short, repetitive sentence frames (e.g., “I see a hat,” “I want cup,” “I see moon”). Client generally maintained final /p, t, m, n/ in imitated sentences. Some reduction occurred when sentences were less familiar or when he spoke quickly.

Initial /s/ in short sentences\n- Focused on /s/ in short sentences during a picture book activity (“sun is up,” “see sock,” “I see seal”). Client produced initial /s/ correctly in many imitated sentences and maintained it in some semi-spontaneous comments when the target word had been practiced. Still showed occasional /t/ substitutions or omissions, especially in longer or less familiar sentences, but overall there was a slight increase in accuracy and stability.\n\n4. /s/ blends – imitated words, continued\n- Continued practice of /s/ blends (“star, spoon, slide, snow, stop”) at the imitated word level. Client produced a small number of clearer blends with backward chaining, but still frequently omitted the /s/ or reduced the cluster. Accuracy remains inconsistent; this continues to be a challenging area.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue reinforcing final consonants and initial /f/ and /s/ in short sentences, aiming for more spontaneous use in structured play.\n- Maintain /s/ blends at the imitated word level with strong support; not yet ready to move to phrases.\n- Home practice: encourage use of practiced sentences while reading simple picture books (e.g., “I see a sun,” “The fish is big”); parent to praise clear final sounds and accurate /f/ and /s/ productions."

She hears strong final sounds in many words, and family members have commented that he is “clearer.” She still notices dropped sounds when he is excited or talking quickly. No new concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client transitioned easily and appeared very comfortable in the therapy setting. He was engaged with both game-based and book-based tasks and followed directions well. Participation remained strong throughout the session.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final consonants – short sentences and conversation\n- Practiced final consonants within short sentences and then observed in more natural play-based conversation. In structured sentences, client consistently produced final /p, t, m, n/ with good clarity. During play, he maintained many final consonants spontaneously, though some omissions still occurred in rapid speech. Overall skill appeared stable compared to last session, with ongoing good performance in structured tasks and emerging generalization.\n\n2. Initial /f/ – short sentences and spontaneous attempts\n- Continued targeting /f/ within short sentences (“The fish is blue,” “Four frogs jump”) and monitored spontaneous use. In imitation, /f/ remained accurate and required little cueing. In spontaneous comments during play (e.g., talking about “food,” “fish,” “four”), he produced several clear /f/ sounds, though not yet in all opportunities. Performance was similar to last week, indicating consolidation of this skill.\n\n3. Initial /s/ – short sentences and structured play\n- Practiced /s/ in short sentences (“sun is up,” “I see soap,” “sock on foot”) and in simple play routines. Client’s initial /s/ was generally accurate in imitated sentences and sometimes carried over into semi-spontaneous phrases. Occasional substitutions persisted, especially in less familiar words or when he was excited. Overall, performance was comparable to previous session with continued gradual consolidation.\n\n4. /s/ blends – imitated word level\n- Revisited /s/ blends (“star, spoon, slide, snow, stop”) in a game format. Client continued to find blends challenging and frequently omitted the /s/ or simplified the cluster. A few accurate productions were observed with heavy support, but overall skill remained at a similar level to prior sessions.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to support generalization of final consonants and initial /f/ and /s/ into more spontaneous speech while maintaining structured practice.\n- Keep /s/ blends at the imitated word level; consider varying materials to maintain motivation.\n- Home practice: parent to highlight and praise clear final sounds and /f/, /s/ words during everyday routines, and to continue brief supported practice with /s/ blend words like “star” and “snow.”"

He remained engaged in structured activities, enjoyed turn-taking, and responded well to praise. Attention and cooperation were consistent with prior sessions.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final consonants – structured tasks and free play\n- Continued monitoring final consonants in structured sentence tasks and free play. In structured sentences, final consonants remained consistently present and clear. In less structured play, he maintained many final consonants but still dropped some when speaking quickly. Skill level appeared stable, with good maintenance of gains.\n\n2. Initial /f/ – structured and semi-spontaneous use\n- Practiced /f/ in short sentences and observed use in spontaneous comments. Accuracy in imitation remained high with minimal to no cueing. During play, he produced several /f/ words correctly and independently (e.g., “food,” “fish,” “four”), similar to previous session. Performance reflected continued consolidation rather than new change.\n\n3. Initial /s/ – structured sentences\n- Targeted /s/ in short, repetitive sentences and picture description tasks (“sun is yellow,” “soap in sink”).

Overall performance was similar to recent weeks.\n\n4. /s/ blends – imitated words\n- Repeated work on /s/ blends (“star, spoon, slide, snow, stop”) using backward chaining and tactile/visual cues. Client continued to omit /s/ in many attempts, with occasional accurate productions when highly focused. No significant shift from previous sessions; this remains an area of difficulty.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue current therapy focus to support stable generalization of final consonants and initial /f/ and /s/ into everyday speech.\n- Maintain /s/ blend practice with strong support; consider adding more auditory discrimination activities for blends.\n- Home practice: encourage slow, clear speech in short conversations and continue modeling accurate /s/ blends without pressure to repeat every time."

He was cooperative and engaged in both structured and play-based activities, demonstrating good familiarity with the therapy tasks. Attention was steady throughout.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final consonants – review in sentences and play\n- Reviewed final consonants in short sentences and monitored in free play. Client continued to produce final /p, t, m, n/ reliably in structured sentences and frequently in spontaneous speech. Occasional omissions were observed in rapid, excited talk, but overall, this remained a relative strength compared to early sessions.\n\n2. Initial /f/ – review in sentences and conversation\n- Reassessed /f/ productions in short sentences and conversation. In structured tasks, /f/ was consistently accurate without the need for direct cueing. In conversation, he used /f/ correctly in many words (e.g., “fish,” “food,” “four,” “fun”) with only rare substitutions.

She notices he often leaves off sounds at the ends of words and says “tup” for “cup” or “doap” for “soap.” No concerns with hearing or health this week.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned to the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from Mom without tears. Needed a few minutes of free play to warm up, then responded well to structured turn-taking games. Attention was fair; he stayed with adult-directed activities for short bursts (3–4 minutes) with occasional redirection. Enjoyed cars and animal toys and was generally cheerful.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Establish baseline for overall speech sound production\n- During play and picture naming, frequent final consonant deletion (e.g., “bee” for “beep,” “boo” for “book”) and cluster reduction were noted. Intelligibility with the clinician was reduced in unfamiliar contexts, though Mom could often interpret his speech.\n\n2) Final /p, t, k/ at word level (imitation)\n- Introduced CVC words with final /p, t, k/ using picture cards and a simple board game (e.g., “cup, cat, cake, cap, bike, boat”). Client was able to imitate final consonants inconsistently; often added a vowel (“cup-uh”) or omitted the final sound. Rough estimate: about 40–50% accurate in direct imitation with maximal verbal and visual cues (exaggerated mouth movements, tapping the table for the last sound).\n\n3) Initial /k/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- In isolation, client could approximate /k/ with tongue-back cueing and using a “cough sound” trick, but often fronted to /t/ (“tar” for “car”). At the CV syllable level (e.g., “kee, koo, kah”), productions were mostly /t/ despite simultaneous modeling. Accuracy for clear /k/ in initial position was low; client required maximal cueing and slow pacing.\n\n4) Syllable shape practice (CVCV)\n- Practiced simple CVCV patterns (e.g., “mama, puppy, baby”) in play. Client enjoyed repeating these and was more successful with reduplicated syllables (e.g., “mama”) than alternating ones (e.g., “bunny”). Productions were often approximated but generally recognizable.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to target final /p, t, k/ at the imitated word level, focusing on awareness of the “last sound” in words.\n- Maintain work on initial /k/ in isolation and simple syllables with heavy visual/tactile support.\n- Provide Mom with a short list of final /p/ words (“cup, up, soup”) to model at home during daily routines, emphasizing the last sound without pressuring him to repeat.\n- Monitor overall intelligibility and tolerance for structured practice in upcoming sessions."

She has been trying to emphasize the end sounds in words like “cup” and “up” during snack time; she feels he occasionally “gets it,” but it’s not consistent.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient entered the room more easily today and quickly chose preferred toys. He was playful and cooperative for most of the session, with brief periods of silliness (e.g., making silly sounds instead of target words) when tasks became more challenging. Responded well to visual supports and game-based practice.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final /p, t, k/ at word level (imitation)\n- Continued CVC word practice in a turn-taking board game. Compared with last week, he showed a noticeable jump in accuracy when imitating final /p/ and /t/ with clear visual models. He produced final /p/ fairly consistently in words like “cup, up, pop,” especially when the SLP tapped for the last sound. Final /k/ remained harder, often fronted to /t/ (“back” → “bat”). Overall, accuracy and consistency were higher than baseline, with fewer “extra vowels” added at the end.\n\n2) Initial /k/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- Used mirror work and a “back of the mouth” cue to help him feel the /k/ sound. He began to produce a clearer /k/ in isolation several times with support. At the CV level, he approximated /k/ in “koo, kah” with moderate cues, though still often reverted to /t/ in words (“car, key”). There was a slight improvement in his awareness; he sometimes attempted to correct himself after hearing the SLP’s model.\n\n3) CVCV and multisyllabic word practice\n- Practiced CVCV words (e.g., “bunny, puppy, teddy”) in a picture book activity. Most syllables were present but some consonants were unclear. With slow modeling and clapping syllables, he was able to imitate 2–3 syllable words like “banana, dinosaur” in a simplified form.\n\n4) Early /s/ awareness (listening)\n- Briefly introduced listening discrimination for /s/ vs. no /s/ in simple words using a “sound detective” game (e.g., “sun” vs. “un”). He could usually identify when the SLP used the “snake sound,” though this was not yet targeted for production.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on final /p, t, k/ at imitated word level; gradually reduce cueing when possible.\n- Continue intensive work on initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables, watching for opportunities to move into simple words.\n- Encourage Mom to continue modeling final /p/ and /t/ in everyday routines, praising any attempts to include the last sound.\n- Keep /s/ at the listening/awareness level for now; not yet a primary production target."

She still feels he is hard to understand for new people. No new health concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned smoothly and appeared excited to “play the sound games.” He sustained attention well with brief movement breaks between activities. Minimal avoidance; he accepted correction and models without frustration and enjoyed choosing stickers as rewards.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final /p, t, k/ at word level (imitation and emerging cued independence)\n- In a picture card race game, he produced final /p/ and /t/ with increasing consistency. With a model, he was usually accurate; with only a reminder to “remember the last sound,” he could sometimes produce the word clearly without direct imitation. Final /k/ remained more inconsistent but showed clearer productions in a few high-frequency words like “back” and “book.” Overall, performance reflected slightly increased independence compared to last session.\n\n2) Initial /k/ at word level (imitation)\n- Practiced initial /k/ words (“car, key, cow, cookie”) using a car ramp activity. With visual and verbal cues (“tongue in the back”), he produced more recognizable /k/ sounds than previously. Accuracy was still mixed, but there were more correct productions and fewer /t/ substitutions. He occasionally paused and tried again after hearing his own error, indicating emerging self-monitoring.\n\n3) CVCV and simple multisyllabic words\n- Continued CVCV practice with toys and picture books (e.g., “baby, kitty, robot”). He was able to mark most syllables when imitating longer words like “banana” and “elephant,” though some consonants were simplified. He responded well to clapping and tapping for each syllable.\n\n4) Early /s/ production in isolation\n- Briefly introduced /s/ in isolation using a “snake sound” puppet. He could imitate a prolonged /s/ sound when focused, but tended to add a vowel after it (“suh”). No structured word-level /s/ work yet.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue practicing final /p, t, k/, with a goal of increasing independent (non-imitative) productions during play.\n- Maintain focus on initial /k/ words with consistent cueing; trial simple carrier phrases (“my car”) as accuracy improves.\n- Encourage Mom to highlight both beginning and ending sounds in a few target words at home (e.g., “car, cup, cat”).\n- Keep /s/ at isolation/imitation level only for now, focusing on sustained airflow and lip/tongue posture."

He remained engaged for the majority of structured tasks, needing brief breaks with cars between activities. He was proud of his “good sounds” and enjoyed verbal praise and high-fives.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final /p, t, k/ at word level and emerging phrases\n- Continued CVC word practice in a fishing game and then expanded to short phrases (e.g., “big cup, red hat, my book”) when accuracy in single words was good. He maintained relatively strong performance for final /p/ and /t/ in imitation and with light cues. Final /k/ continued to be more variable but showed some clearer productions in familiar words. Compared to last session, accuracy appears slightly more consistent but still requires frequent cueing.\n\n2) Initial /k/ at word level (imitation) and early phrases\n- Used a car-themed activity to practice initial /k/ in words (“car, key, coat, cookie”) and then in two-word combinations (“my car, big cookie”) when possible. He produced more accurate /k/ sounds than in earlier sessions but still fronted to /t/ intermittently. He benefited from slowing down and using a mirror. Small gains were noted in consistency, though cueing needs remain similar.\n\n3) /s/ in isolation and simple CV syllables\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation (“snake sound”) and in CV patterns (e.g., “see, soo”) using a puppet and bubbles. He was able to produce a prolonged /s/ with a closed-mouth smile posture when reminded. In CV syllables, he often added a slight “t” or “d” onset but could improve with modeling. This represents early emerging accuracy but is not yet stable.\n\n4) Syllable structure and prosody\n- Briefly targeted 2–3 syllable words during book reading. He could imitate “dinosaur, octopus” with most syllables present but with simplified consonants. Rhythm and stress patterns were generally intact.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating final /p, t, k/ at word level and begin to incorporate more short phrases when accuracy allows.\n- Maintain work on initial /k/ at word and early phrase levels, focusing on consistent tongue-back placement.\n- Keep /s/ practice at isolation and simple syllables, emphasizing airflow and posture.\n- Mom encouraged to practice a small set of /k/ and final consonant words during play, using positive feedback rather than correction-focused language."

He followed routines easily and participated actively in both table-top and floor-based tasks. Occasional distraction by nearby toys, but he responded to simple prompts to return to the activity. No signs of frustration with correction.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final /p, t, k/ at word and short phrase level\n- Practiced final consonants in a picture lotto game and then in short descriptive phrases (e.g., “big cup, hot soup, red hat, my book”). Final /p/ and /t/ were generally reliable in imitation and often maintained when the SLP faded to a verbal reminder only. Final /k/ remained less consistent but showed some clearer productions, particularly in repeated practice of “back, book, snack.” Performance is similar to last week with some emerging stability at the phrase level.\n\n2) Initial /k/ words and two-word combinations\n- Used a play kitchen set to target /k/ words (“cup, cookie, corn, cake”) and two-word combinations (“my cookie, cut cake”). He produced recognizable /k/ more frequently, especially in high-interest words like “cookie.” However, he still fronted to /t/ at times, and accuracy improved with slow modeling and mirror cues. Gains from previous sessions appear to be holding, with a small increase in consistency.\n\n3) /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on the “snake sound” in isolation and in simple syllables (“see, soo, say”). He could produce a sustained /s/ when focused, though he occasionally added a brief vowel. CV syllables were approximated with mild distortions but generally resembled the target. Accuracy appears slightly improved but still requires frequent modeling.\n\n4) Multisyllabic word imitation\n- Brief practice with 3-syllable words (“banana, butterfly, computer”) during book reading. Most syllables were present, with some sound simplification. This remains a secondary goal.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating final consonants at both word and short phrase levels, particularly final /k/.\n- Maintain initial /k/ work in functional play contexts; continue to encourage slow, careful speech.\n- Keep /s/ at isolation and simple syllable practice; not yet ready for consistent word-level work.\n- Mom encouraged to model and gently highlight /k/ and final sounds in daily routines, praising attempts rather than pointing out errors."

He continued to produce /k/ correctly in many imitated trials, especially with mirror and tongue-back cues. Occasional /t/ substitutions persisted. Overall performance was comparable to last week; no major shift in level or independence noted.\n\n3) /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced sustained /s/ and CV syllables (“see, soo, say, soo-see”) with a “snake path” board. He was able to maintain airflow for /s/ when given a visual cue (finger sliding on the table) and produced CV syllables with mild distortions but recognizable “s” quality. Skills are consolidating at this level without substantial change from the previous session.\n\n4) Multisyllabic word imitation (brief)\n- Short review of 2–3 syllable words during story time.

Cueing level and success appeared stable relative to last week.\n\n3) /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on sustained /s/ and CV syllables using a “snake race” game. He could produce a clear, continuous /s/ with reminders to keep his tongue behind his teeth. CV syllables remained somewhat inconsistent but were often recognizable. No major shift from last session; skills are holding steady at this level.\n\n4) Brief generalization in play\n- During free play, the SLP modeled target words within simple phrases and occasionally heard spontaneous approximations with final consonants (e.g., “my cup”). These were infrequent but encouraging.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain current targets and levels for another week to support consolidation.\n- Continue home modeling of final consonants and /k/ in familiar words, emphasizing slow speech and praising attempts.\n- Monitor for consistent improvements that would indicate readiness to expand /k/ and final consonant targets to more spontaneous contexts."

She noted that he is \"chatty\" at home but often leaves off the ends of words and mixes up his /k/ and /t/ sounds. No recent changes in health or hearing.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client transitioned to the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from mom with verbal reassurance. Once in the room, he warmed up and participated well in play-based tasks. Attention was fair; required several redirections away from preferred toys to structured activities.\n\nGoals/therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CV → CVC words)\n- Targeted final /p/, /t/, and /m/ at the imitated word level (e.g., \"cup, cap, cat, hat, home, ham\").\n- Client frequently omitted final consonants in spontaneous speech (\"cu\" for \"cup\"). With direct imitation and visual cueing (touching lips for /p/, tapping chin for final sound), he produced clearer CVC words in about half of opportunities. Final /m/ was easiest; /t/ was often reduced to a softer or omitted sound.\n\n2. Initial /k/ vs /t/ (back vs front sounds)\n- Introduced /k/ in isolation using a \"back sound\" cue (tongue up and back, open mouth). In isolation, he could approximate /k/ intermittently, often defaulting to /t/.\n- At the syllable level (\"ku, ki, ko\"), accuracy was low; most productions were fronted to /t/. Needed maximal verbal models, mirror work, and tactile cues to the throat area to increase awareness of the \"back\" sound.\n\n3. Early syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Observed and elicited CV and reduplicated CVCV (e.g., \"mama, dada, baba\") in play. Client produced CV shapes easily and used them spontaneously. For alternating CVCV (e.g., \"bunny, kitty\"), some consonant changes or vowel distortions were noted, but overall syllable structure was present.\n\n4. Functional words/short phrases in play\n- Encouraged use of short 2–3 word phrases (e.g., \"my turn,\" \"more bubbles,\" \"go car\") with models and imitation. Client imitated several phrases but often reduced them to 1–2 words and unclear final sounds. Intelligibility was better with familiar routines and when context was clear.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on final consonant production in CVC words and establishing a more consistent /k/ in isolation and simple syllables.\n- Suggested parents emphasize final sounds during daily routines (e.g., “cup-p,” “bed-d”) using slow, clear models without pressure to imitate every time.\n- Next session: re-check /k/ in isolation, continue CVC with final /p, t, m/, and consider simple minimal pairs if ready."

Client was curious about new toys and engaged well in structured play. Attention to task improved compared to last week; required fewer prompts to return to activities. Cooperative with mirror work.\n\nGoals/therapy activities:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words (p, t, m)\n- Practiced final /p, t, m/ at the imitated word level using picture cards and a simple board game.\n- Accuracy for final /m/ and /p/ noticeably improved with a model and visual cue (tapping at the end of the word). Client often self-corrected when cued to “listen for the last sound.”\n- Final /t/ remained more inconsistent; he sometimes substituted a softer or distorted sound or left it off entirely. However, he produced a few clear final /t/ words (e.g., \"hat,\" \"cat\") with moderate verbal cueing.\n\n2. Initial /k/ production (isolation → syllables)\n- Returned to /k/ in isolation using “cough” and “back sound” cues. Client produced a more distinct /k/ in isolation in about half of trials with strong modeling.\n- At the CV syllable level (\"ku, ka\"), still frequently fronted to /t/, but there were a few clearer /k/ attempts today with maximal support. Able to hear the difference when SLP contrasted /k/ vs /t/ in some minimal pairs.\n\n3. CVCV words and early multisyllabic attempts\n- Practiced CVCV words (\"bunny, puppy, kitty\") in imitation. Most syllables were present, though some consonants were simplified (e.g., \"bubby\" for \"bunny\").\n- Client showed increased willingness to repeat longer words compared to last session and enjoyed listening and repeating animal names.\n\n4. Functional 2–3 word phrases\n- Modeled and elicited short phrases (\"more bubbles,\" \"open door,\" \"my car\"). Client imitated several with clearer initial sounds; final sounds still often reduced.\n- Some spontaneous 2-word combinations observed in play (\"my car,\" \"more please\"), with mixed intelligibility but improved willingness to communicate.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Progress since last week suggests emerging accuracy with final consonants and slightly more consistent /k/ attempts. Continue at current level to consolidate.\n- Encourage parents to highlight final sounds in natural play (e.g., \"You found the hat-t\") and praise any attempts.\n- Next session: continue CVC final /p, t, m/, maintain focus on establishing /k/ in isolation and CV, and add a few simple minimal pairs for /t/ vs /k/ if attention allows."

Good participation overall; brief episodes of silliness when tasks became more challenging, but he responded to gentle redirection. Tolerated structured turn-taking games.\n\nGoals/therapy activities:\n1.

Final /t/ is emerging; produced several accurate examples today, though still omitted /t/ when speaking quickly.\n- Beginning to carry over some final consonants in short spontaneous comments during play, especially for /m/ (e.g., “yum,” “ham”).\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued with “back sound” teaching using mirror and visual of a mouth. In isolation, /k/ was produced more reliably with less effort than in previous sessions.\n- At the CV level (\"ka, ku\"), there were a few more accurate /k/ productions, but fronting to /t/ remains common. Client could sometimes distinguish the SLP’s /k/ vs /t/ when listening.\n\n3. Early minimal pairs /t/ vs /k/ (listening and imitation)\n- Introduced simple minimal pairs (\"tea/key,\" \"toe/coat\") at a listening level first. Client did fairly well identifying which word the clinician said when paired with visuals.\n- When attempting to imitate, he often produced both as /t/, but there were a few approximations of /k/ with maximal cueing.\n\n4. Short functional phrases\n- Used play routines (feeding animals, parking cars) to encourage 2–3 word phrases (\"more food,\" \"my car,\" \"big cat\"). Client imitated many phrases and initiated several 2-word combinations spontaneously.\n- Intelligibility within the session was slightly improved, especially when he slowed down and watched the clinician’s mouth.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Noted small but consistent gains in final consonant production and early self-monitoring. Continue at current level while building consistency.\n- Home practice: families to continue emphasizing final sounds in a few target words and model clear /k/ vs /t/ contrasts during play, without pressuring for perfection.\n- Next session: maintain work on CVC final /p, t, m/, continue /k/ isolation and CV, and expand minimal pair listening games as tolerated."

Client produced final /p/ and /m/ fairly consistently in these phrases with only occasional reminders; final /t/ still less consistent but showed more clear productions than earlier in the block.\n\n2. Initial /k/ – isolation to simple syllables\n- In isolation, /k/ was produced correctly in the majority of attempts when he used the “back sound” strategy.\n- In CV syllables (\"ka, ko, ku\"), he produced a mix of /k/ and /t/, with a slight increase in accurate /k/ productions compared to last session. Continued to require maximal verbal and visual cueing, but he appeared more aware of the difference.\n\n3. /t/ vs /k/ minimal pairs – listening and production\n- Revisited minimal pairs (\"tea/key,\" \"toe/coat,\" \"two/cow\"). Client showed good listening discrimination with visual supports, correctly identifying the clinician’s target most of the time.\n- In imitation, he occasionally produced a clearer /k/ in the \"key\" and \"coat\" words when reminded to \"pull tongue back,\" though many attempts were still fronted.\n\n4. Functional phrases with target words\n- Incorporated target CVC words into short phrases (\"more ham,\" \"big cup,\" \"my cap\"). Client imitated many phrases with improved final consonant clarity.\n- A few spontaneous short phrases were noted during play (\"my cup,\" \"big cat\"), with final consonants present in some instances.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Client is demonstrating emerging independence with final consonants and slightly more consistent /k/ attempts. Continue building stability at this level before moving to more complex contexts.\n- Home practice: encourage use of a small set of “practice words” (cup, cap, cat, ham, map) in daily routines, praising any clear final sounds.\n- Next session: continue CVC work, begin trialing a few simple phrases with consistent final /p, m/, and maintain intensive support for /k/ in CV syllables and minimal pairs."

Maintained attention well across several structured games. Showed pride when he produced a clear word and responded well to visual feedback in the mirror.\n\nGoals/therapy activities:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words – word to phrase level\n- Practiced final /p, t, m/ across a larger set of words using a fishing game and picture cards.\n- At the imitated word level, accuracy for final /p/ and /m/ was high with minimal cueing; /t/ remained slightly less consistent but improved from prior sessions.\n- Transitioned some targets into short carrier phrases (\"I see the cup,\" \"big cat,\" \"my map\").

Listening discrimination remained strong.\n- During production, he continued to mix /t/ and /k/, though a few more correct /k/ productions were observed with maximal cueing. This remains an area of ongoing practice.\n\n4. Functional phrases with target sounds\n- Integrated target words into short, functional phrases during play (\"my car,\" \"big cup,\" \"more ham\").\n- Client imitated many phrases and produced some spontaneously, with clearer final consonants than earlier in the block.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Progress this week reflects continued strengthening of previously targeted skills rather than a big jump. Maintain current goals to consolidate gains, especially for final /t/ and initial /k/.\n- Home practice: encourage slow, clear productions of practice words in simple phrases and continue contrasting /t/ vs /k/ in play.\n- Next session: re-assess consistency of final /p, t, m/ at phrase level and consider introducing a small set of new /k/ words if current targets remain stable."

Needed occasional redirection back to tasks.\n\nGoals and session activities:\n1. Establish baseline for overall speech sound production\n- Collected an informal speech sample in play and structured naming tasks.\n- Noted reduced intelligibility in connected speech, with patterns including: cluster reduction (e.g., \"top\" for \"stop\"), occasional final consonant deletion, and difficulty with /k/ and /g/ (fronting to /t/ and /d/).\n- Child was willing to repeat single words when prompted but often required a model and visual cueing.\n\n2. Initial /s/ at word level (imitation)\n- Introduced initial /s/ in simple words (sun, sock, soup, soap, see).\n- With direct imitation and visual cue (watching clinician’s mouth), child approximated /s/ in about half of attempts; frequent substitutions to /d/ or omitted /s/ (\"un\" for \"sun\").\n- Able to hear the difference when clinician contrasted correct vs. incorrect productions, but not yet consistently self-correcting.\n\n3. Initial /f/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- Practiced /f/ in syllables (\"faa,\" \"fee,\" \"foo\") and simple words (fish, foot, fun).\n- Tended to stop /f/ to /p/ in words (\"pish\" for \"fish\").\n- With verbal cue to “bite your lip and blow,” child could briefly shape an accurate /f/ in isolation; carryover into words was inconsistent.\n\n4. CV and CVC syllable shapes\n- Practiced consonant-vowel (CV) and consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) structures using picture cards and play.\n- CV shapes generally intact (e.g., \"bee,\" \"moo\"); CVC words often missing final consonant (\"bee\" for \"bed,\" \"pi\" for \"pig\").\n- With immediate imitation and clinician emphasizing the final sound, child occasionally added the final consonant but did not yet do this independently.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to focus on initial /s/ and /f/ at the imitated word level, and on marking final consonants in CVC words.\n- Provided caregiver with simple practice words for /s/ (sun, sock, soup) and /f/ (fish, foot, fun) to model once or twice daily in play, emphasizing slow, clear speech and praising all attempts.\n- Next session: further probe /k/ and /g/ and continue building consistency for /s/ and /f/ in imitation."

Final consonants in CVC words\n- Target words: bed, bus, cup, dog, cat.\n- With imitation and emphasis on the “end sound,” child marked final consonants more often today, especially /p/ and /t/.\n- Still omitted some final sounds in spontaneous speech but showed increased willingness to repeat and try again.\n\n4. Probe of initial /k/\n- Briefly probed /k/ in isolation and initial position (car, key, cow).\n- Continued to front to /t/ in words (\"tar\" for \"car\").\n- With tongue-back cue (\"back sound\"), child could approximate /k/ in isolation a few times, but carryover to words was limited.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on initial /s/ and /f/ at imitated word level, with opportunities for simple spontaneous use during play.\n- Continue practice of final consonants in a small set of familiar CVC words.\n- Home: encourage short, playful practice of 3–5 /s/ words daily, praising effort and any clear “snake sounds.”\n- Next session: continue building consistency and consider expanding /s/ practice to short carrier phrases if accuracy remains improved."

She notices he often leaves off the ends of words and says “t” or “d” for many other sounds. No major changes since the initial assessment.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- 4-year-old boy, transitioned to therapy room with some hesitation but separated from mom with reassurance. Once engaged with toys, he was cheerful and talkative. Attention was fair; he needed intermittent redirection back to tasks but generally participated.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Establish production of early consonants in isolation (p, b, m, t, d, k, g)\n- Probed a range of consonants in isolation and in simple CV syllables during play. He could imitate /p, b, m/ in isolation with good accuracy when given a clear model and visual cueing (watching clinician’s mouth). /t, d/ were often produced with an added vowel (\"tuh, duh\"). /k, g/ were fronted to /t, d/ in most attempts despite maximal verbal, visual, and some tactile cues (e.g., touching throat, cueing tongue \"at the back\").\n\n2) Final consonant production at word level (CVC words)\n- Baseline probes for final /p, m, t/ in single words (e.g., “cup, nap, map, hat, sit”) in imitation. He frequently omitted the final consonant or replaced it with a neutral vowel (e.g., “cu_,” “si_”). Occasional accurate final /p/ with intensive modeling and segmenting (\"cu—P\"). Overall low accuracy; remained at highly supported, imitated level.\n\n3) Initial /k/ and /g/ at syllable and word level\n- Targeted initial /k/ and /g/ in CV syllables (\"ku, ki, go, ga\") using mirror, tongue-back visual cue, and play-based activities (feeding toy animals). Consistent fronting to /t, d/ despite maximal cueing; only rare approximations of /k/ in isolation. Not yet ready to move beyond imitation.\n\n4) Overall intelligibility in simple play\n- During unstructured play, speech was often difficult to understand without contextual support. Frequent final consonant deletion and fronting patterns noted. He was talkative and attempted to communicate, but required frequent clarification requests.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue weekly therapy focusing on establishing accurate production of final consonants (especially /p, m, t/) in imitation and increasing awareness of \"back\" sounds /k, g/ in isolation.\n- Home practice: caregiver to practice simple CVC words with final /p/ (e.g., \"cup, up, nap\") using slow, exaggerated models and pausing for his attempt. Encourage praise for any attempt at a final sound, not just perfect productions.\n- Will monitor tolerance for tactile cues and consider additional visual supports (picture cards, gesture cues) next session."

She has been practicing \"up\" and \"cup\" at home; she hears the \"p\" sometimes but says it’s “hit or miss.”\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Smooth transition into the room today, no hesitation. Highly motivated by cars and animal toys. Attention was good for short structured tasks when activities were rotated frequently. Followed simple directions and responded well to praise and visual reinforcement.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final /p/ in CVC words (imitation)\n- Practiced CVC words with final /p/ (\"up, cup, nap, map, hop, top\") in imitation with visual cueing (touching lips together, slow models). Accuracy improved across the session: started with frequent omissions, but by mid-session he produced a clear final /p/ on many trials, especially \"up\" and \"cup.\" Still inconsistent for longer or less familiar words (e.g., \"nap, hop\"). Needed verbal reminders to \"close your lips at the end\" but responded well.\n\n2) Final /m/ in CVC words (imitation)\n- Introduced final /m/ in words such as \"ham, mom, gum, jam\" at imitated word level. Initially omitted the /m/ or replaced with a prolonged vowel, but with modeling and tactile cue to feel vibration on lips, he produced more accurate final /m/ in several attempts. Still required significant support, but a few clear productions were noted in structured drill.\n\n3) Initial /k/ in CV and CVC words (imitation)\n- Continued work on initial /k/ in syllables and simple words (\"key, car, cow, cookie\"). Used mirror, \"tongue up and back\" cue, and play with a toy car garage. He produced a few closer approximations to /k/ in isolation with maximal verbal and visual cues. In words, productions remained mostly fronted to /t/, though he occasionally paused and attempted to adjust his tongue after cues.\n\n4) Awareness of final consonants in play\n- During play, the clinician highlighted final sounds (e.g., “Look, cuP!”) and had him identify if he heard the \"end sound.\" He showed emerging awareness by sometimes nodding or repeating the clinician’s model with more emphasis on the final consonant, though spontaneous use of final sounds remained rare.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to target final /p/ and /m/ in CVC words at the imitated level, reinforcing his emerging correct productions.\n- Home practice: caregiver to focus on 3–4 familiar /p/ final words (\"up, cup, nap, hop\"), using a short game (e.g., feeding items into a box) and praising any attempts at closing the lips at the end.\n- Maintain work on establishing /k/ in isolation and simple syllables; not yet ready to move to phrases.\n- Next session will re-check consistency of final /p/ and consider adding a few more CVC targets if accuracy continues to improve."

She also noticed he sometimes tries to correct himself when she models the word slowly.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Entered the therapy room willingly and quickly engaged with a car racing game. Attention and participation were strong today; he accepted turn-taking and followed structured tasks well with minimal redirection.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final /p/ in CVC words – imitation and early spontaneous use\n- Practiced a set of CVC words with final /p/ (\"up, cup, nap, hop, tap, pop\"). In imitation, accuracy was consistently high across the session with minimal cueing (occasional reminder to \"pop your lips\" at the end). During structured play, he began to use some of these words spontaneously (e.g., saying \"up\" and \"pop\" during bubble and car play) with a clearly audible final /p\" in many attempts. A few omissions still occurred, but overall there was a noticeable increase in independence and consistency.\n\n2) Final /m/ in CVC words – imitation\n- Targeted final /m/ in words such as \"ham, mom, gum, jam, home.\" Compared to last week, he produced more accurate final /m/ in imitation with moderate cueing (tactile cue to lips and verbal reminder to \"hum at the end\"). Still less consistent than final /p/, but more frequent correct productions were observed, especially with \"mom\" and \"gum.\"\n\n3) Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued to focus on establishing /k/ in isolation and simple syllables (\"ku, ki, ka\"). He showed better control today, producing several clear /k/ sounds in isolation with intensive verbal and visual cues (mirror, \"tongue back\" cue). In CV syllables, approximations were closer to /k/ but still inconsistent; he occasionally self-corrected after hearing the clinician’s model.\n\n4) Carryover of final consonants in short phrases\n- Briefly explored final /p/ in short 2-word combinations (e.g., \"up car,\" \"pop bubbles\") in structured play. With a model, he could imitate these short phrases, generally maintaining the final /p/ in the target word. This was trial-level work only but suggests readiness to begin expanding beyond single words for final /p/.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on final /p/ at the word level while gradually increasing practice in simple 2-word phrases when accuracy is high.\n- Continue building consistency with final /m/ in imitation; keep practice to a small set of familiar words.\n- Ongoing work on /k/ in isolation and CV syllables; will not yet push to word-level spontaneously.\n- Home practice: encourage playful repetition of \"up, cup, pop\" during daily routines (e.g., snack, playtime), praising when he “remembers the end sound.”"

She feels close family members are understanding him a bit more, but strangers still have difficulty.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Very eager to come into the therapy room and immediately requested favorite toys. He was highly engaged with structured games today and tolerated brief drill activities between play turns. Mild silliness at times, but easily redirected.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final /p/ in words and short phrases\n- Practiced CVC words with final /p/ (\"up, cup, nap, pop, top, tap\") and then embedded them into short carrier phrases (\"my cup,\" \"pop it,\" \"go up\"). At the single-word level, he produced final /p/ accurately in most imitated attempts with only light verbal reminders. In short phrases, he generally maintained the final consonant when the target word was in a salient position (e.g., last in the phrase), though occasional omissions occurred when speech rate increased.\n\n2) Final /m/ in CVC words\n- Continued final /m/ targets (\"mom, gum, home, jam, ham\"). He showed improved consistency in imitation compared to previous sessions, especially for \"mom\" and \"gum.\" Still needed moderate verbal cues (\"close lips and hum\") and benefited from slower pacing. Accuracy was variable in longer or less familiar words.\n\n3) Initial /k/ in CV/CVC words (imitation)\n- Focused on initial /k/ in simple words (\"key, car, cow, cookie\") using mirror and tactile cues (touching under chin, cueing tongue back). He produced some clearer /k/ sounds in isolation and a few accurate or near-accurate productions in words like \"car\" with maximal support. Fronting to /t/ is still his default, but there were more frequent approximations and attempts to adjust his tongue placement.\n\n4) Awareness of \"end sounds\" in play\n- During free play, the clinician highlighted final consonants in familiar words and asked him to \"listen for the end sound.\" He was able to point to a picture representing the \"end sound\" in some trials after hearing the clinician’s model. Spontaneous use of final consonants outside of practice words is still limited but starting to appear occasionally.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue strengthening final /p/ at the phrase level while monitoring consistency and readiness to introduce a few simple sentences.\n- Maintain final /m/ practice at the imitated word level, focusing on a limited core set of words.\n- Keep building foundational control for /k/ in isolation and simple CV structures; not yet ready to move to spontaneous /k/ in words.\n- Home practice: parent to model short phrases with final /p/ words (e.g., \"go up,\" \"pop it\") and encourage him to repeat, emphasizing slow, clear endings."

He still uses \"pop\" and \"up\" well in play, but she hasn’t noticed many new words with clear endings.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Arrived a bit tired but transitioned into the room without difficulty. Needed a little more encouragement to start structured tasks but warmed up with a preferred puzzle and then participated well. Attention was adequate with short breaks.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final /p/ in words and 2–3 word phrases\n- Continued practice with final /p/ CVC words and short phrases (\"my cup,\" \"pop it,\" \"go up,\" \"top car\"). His accuracy at the single-word level remained similar to last session—generally strong in imitation with minimal cueing. In phrases, he maintained the final /p/ in many attempts, but omissions still occurred when he spoke quickly or became excited. Overall performance appeared stable with no major change from last week, which is appropriate for consolidation.\n\n2) Final /m/ in CVC words\n- Revisited final /m/ words (\"mom, gum, home, jam, ham\"). He continued to require moderate cueing and slower pacing. Accuracy was similar to the previous session, with clearer productions for familiar items like \"mom\" and less consistency for newer words. No notable regression, but also no clear jump in independence.\n\n3) Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Worked again on /k/ in isolation and CV syllables (\"ku, ka, ki\"). He produced a few accurate /k/ sounds when given intensive modeling and visual feedback in the mirror, but continued to default to /t/ in spontaneous attempts. Performance was comparable to last week, with some good individual trials but not yet consistent.\n\n4) General intelligibility in structured play\n- In a simple play routine (feeding animals, driving cars), his overall intelligibility to the clinician remained limited without context. The clinician often needed to clarify or ask him to repeat. However, when using practiced /p/ final words, his clarity improved.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain current targets for another week to consolidate gains, especially final /p/ at phrase level.\n- Continue final /m/ work with the same familiar set of words before introducing additional vocabulary.\n- Ongoing focus on /k/ placement in isolation; may explore additional visual supports (e.g., picture of \"cough\" or \"cat\" with emphasis on the back sound).\n- Home practice: encourage brief daily practice of \"up, cup, pop\" in short phrases during routine activities, keeping it playful and low-pressure."

She also noticed he is starting to copy her when she slows down words for him.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Came into the room independently and was enthusiastic about therapy activities. Maintained good attention to table-top tasks when these were embedded in turn-taking games. Followed directions and accepted feedback well.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final /p/ in short sentences\n- Expanded practice to simple 3–4 word sentences containing final /p/ words (e.g., \"I go up,\" \"I pop it,\" \"My cup here\"). At the word level, accuracy for final /p/ remained strong. In short sentences, he was able to maintain the final /p/ in many imitated sentences and began to produce some short sentences more independently during play (e.g., \"go up\" on the slide toy). Occasional omissions still occurred, but there was a noticeable increase in his ability to carry the final consonant over into connected speech.\n\n2) Final /m/ in CVC words and early phrases\n- Practiced final /m/ words (\"mom, gum, home\") and embedded them into brief 2-word combinations (e.g., \"mom here,\" \"gum please\") at the imitated level. He showed better consistency today, especially with \"mom\" in both single words and short phrases. Still required moderate verbal reminders and slower pacing, but correct productions were more frequent than in previous weeks.\n\n3) Initial /k/ in CV/CVC words (imitation)\n- Targeted initial /k/ words (\"key, car, cat, cookie\") using mirror, \"back of the mouth\" cue, and a car-race game. He produced several accurate /k/ sounds in isolation and some closer approximations in words, particularly \"car\" and \"cat,\" when given a strong model and visual cues. Compared to prior sessions, he needed slightly fewer repetitions of the model to achieve a good /k/, indicating moderate progress.\n\n4) Early self-monitoring of final sounds\n- The clinician occasionally asked him, \"Did you say your end sound?\" after a target word. He was sometimes able to repeat the word with a clearer final consonant when prompted, showing emerging self-correction.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build final /p/ into short, functional sentences, while monitoring for consistency and readiness to introduce additional final consonants at the sentence level.\n- Maintain final /m/ in words and short phrases, reinforcing his increased accuracy.\n- Keep targeting /k/ at the imitated word level, aiming to increase the number of clear productions per session.\n- Home practice: caregiver to encourage short phrases and simple sentences with final /p/ and /m/ words (e.g., \"my cup,\" \"mom home\"), and to gently prompt, \"Can you say your end sound?\" when appropriate."

She also thinks his \"car\" is starting to sound a little different, though she’s not sure exactly how.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Entered the therapy room with a big smile and quickly engaged in play. Very cooperative with both play-based and more structured practice. Needed only minimal redirection.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final /p/ in short sentences and semi-spontaneous play\n- Continued 3–4 word sentences including final /p/ (\"I go up,\" \"I pop it,\" \"Put it up\"). At the imitated sentence level, he maintained high accuracy for final /p\" with light cueing. During semi-structured play (bubbles, blocks), he produced some of these sentences spontaneously, often preserving the final /p/ without prompting. A few omissions occurred when he was speaking quickly, but overall he showed increasing independence.\n\n2) Final /m/ in words and 2-word phrases\n- Revisited final /m/ targets (\"mom, gum, home, game\") and short 2-word phrases (\"mom here,\" \"home now\"). Compared to last week, his accuracy was slightly higher, with more consistent productions of final /m/ in familiar words. Still benefited from verbal cues and slower rate but required somewhat fewer prompts to achieve a correct production.\n\n3) Initial /k/ in CVC words and simple phrases (imitation)\n- Focused on initial /k/ words (\"car, cat, key, cookie\") and briefly trialed 2-word phrases (\"car go,\" \"key here\") in imitation. He produced more accurate /k/ sounds today, especially in \"car\" and \"cat,\" requiring moderate but not maximal cueing. In short phrases, he sometimes maintained the /k/ but would occasionally revert to /t/. This reflects moderate, ongoing progress with this sound.\n\n4) Overall intelligibility in structured play\n- In a structured play routine with familiar vocabulary, the clinician understood him more easily than at the start of the block, particularly when he used practiced words and phrases with final /p/ and /m/. Intelligibility remained reduced for less familiar words or when he spoke rapidly, but there were clear gains in clarity within practiced contexts.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to practice final /p/ in short sentences and begin to incorporate more varied sentence structures.\n- Maintain focus on final /m/ in a small set of words and phrases to further solidify accuracy.\n- Gradually increase the complexity of /k/ practice at the imitated word and short-phrase level, while ensuring he can still achieve accurate productions.\n- Home practice: encourage use of target sentences during daily routines (e.g., “I go up” on stairs, “pop it” with bubbles). Mom to keep modeling clear /k/ in words like \"car\" and praising any attempts that sound closer."

Stayed engaged with activities and accepted feedback. Mild silliness at the end of the session when he was getting tired, but overall participation was good.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final /p/ in short sentences and early conversation\n- Continued 3–4 word sentences with final /p/ words (\"I go up,\" \"I pop it,\" \"Put it up here\"). In imitation, he maintained a high level of accuracy for final /p/ with very minimal cueing. During more natural play-based conversation, he used several of these sentences spontaneously and typically preserved the final /p/, with only occasional omissions when excited. This suggests stable, strong performance at this level.\n\n2) Final /m/ in CVC words and short phrases\n- Practiced final /m/ in words (\"mom, home, game, gum\") and 2–3 word combinations (\"mom home,\" \"my game\"). There was a slight increase in consistency: he produced clear final /m/ more often, particularly for \"mom\" and \"home,\" though he still required moderate prompting for newer or less familiar words. Accuracy is improving gradually but is not yet as strong as final /p/.\n\n3) Initial /k/ in CVC words and 2-word phrases\n- Continued work on initial /k/ words (\"car, cat, key, cookie\") and short phrases (\"car go,\" \"cat eat\"). He demonstrated more frequent accurate /k/ productions today with moderate cueing and occasionally produced a clearer /k/ in \"car\" without explicit reminders. In short phrases, he sometimes maintained the /k/, though there were still reversions to /t\" when his attention shifted. Overall, this reflects emerging improvement in consistency.\n\n4) Self-monitoring and correction\n- The clinician occasionally asked him to \"check\" his word when the final sound was omitted. He was sometimes able to repeat the word with a clearer final consonant or a better /k/, indicating that early self-monitoring skills are beginning to develop.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to support final /p/ at the sentence level and begin monitoring for generalization to less familiar contexts.\n- Maintain final /m/ work at the word and short-phrase level to support increasing consistency.\n- Keep building accuracy of /k/ at the imitated word and 2-word phrase level, with an emphasis on consistent tongue-back placement.\n- Home practice: encourage him to say \"mom\" and \"home\" slowly with a strong \"mmmm\" at the end, and provide gentle reminders like \"use your back sound\" for /k/ words such as \"car.\""

She reported that he often leaves off sounds at the ends of words (e.g., \"boo\" for \"book\") and sometimes says \"t\" instead of \"k\". No major changes since initial evaluation. Family is motivated to work on home practice once they know what to focus on.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned with some hesitation but separated from Mom with reassurance. He warmed up with toys and became more talkative in play. Attention was fair; he preferred self-directed play and needed frequent redirection back to sound practice. He responded well to visual supports and silly games.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Establish /k/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation using mirror, tongue depressor for awareness (no intraoral stimulation), and “cough” trick. Able to approximate /k/ in isolation in about half of opportunities with maximal verbal and visual cueing.\n- In CV syllables (\"koo, kee, kah\"), productions often shifted to /t/ (\"too, tee, tah\"). When cued to “make the sound in the back,” he could occasionally correct with hand cue to throat.\n\n2) Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, m, t/)\n- Targeted high-frequency words in play (e.g., \"cup, up, map, mat, pop, mop\"). At the imitated word level, he produced the final consonant clearly in some trials but frequently omitted it or added a schwa (\"muh\" for \"m\").\n- Needed models plus visual cue (pointing to a “sound dot” at the end of the word). Accuracy was higher when words were broken into two parts (e.g., \"cu—p\").\n\n3) Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Introduced /f/ as “lip-bite windy sound.” With mirror and clinician model, he could sometimes place his teeth on his lip but often produced /p/ or /h/ instead.\n- In CV syllables (\"foo, fee, fah\"), productions were mostly /pV/ or /hV/. He responded best when reminded to “keep lips together and blow slowly.”\n\n4) Syllable shapes (CV and CVCV)\n- Observed spontaneous use of CV and reduplicated CVCV (\"mama, dada, baba\") in play. Attempted alternating CVCV words (e.g., \"bunny, teddy\"), with some simplification (\"buh-ee\" for \"bunny\").\n- Used clapping to mark each syllable; he joined in and appeared to enjoy the activity, though speech productions were often reduced.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue targeting /k/ in isolation and simple CV syllables next session; maintain focus at sound and syllable level until productions are more consistent.\n- For home practice, encouraged Mom to model and emphasize final sounds in simple words during play (e.g., \"cup-P,\" \"up-P\"), without pressuring for imitation.\n- Plan to introduce simple picture cards for CVC words next week to increase structure while keeping activities play-based."

He engaged well with cars and animal toys and was generally cooperative. Attention to adult-directed tasks was improved; he could participate in short drill games between play turns. Occasional silliness but easily redirected.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on /k/ using mirror and “cough” strategy. Accuracy in isolation was noticeably improved compared to last week; he produced a clear /k/ in most attempts with moderate verbal and visual cues.\n- In CV syllables (\"koo, kah, kee\"), he produced a correct /k/ onset more often, though /t/ substitutions still occurred. Back-of-tongue cue and hand-to-throat gesture supported more consistent productions.\n\n2) /k/ in initial word position (CVC words)\n- Trialed a small set of words (\"car, key, cow, cat\") at the imitated level. With segmented modeling (breaking the word into initial sound + rest of word), he was able to produce an accurate /k/ at the start of several words, though not yet consistent.\n- When given only a full word model, he tended to revert to /t/ (\"tar\" for \"car\").\n\n3) Final consonant production in CVC words (/p, m, t/)\n- Practiced with picture cards and a “feed the animal” game. At the imitated level, final consonants were present more frequently than previous session, especially for /p/ and /m/.\n- He still occasionally omitted the final sound or added a vowel (“cu-puh”). Visual cue (tapping a dot after the word) and slowing the word helped increase accuracy.\n\n4) Initial /f/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Reviewed /f/ with mirror and “bite lip, blow” description. Able to achieve the correct posture more frequently today, though he needed frequent reminders to keep lips together and blow.\n- In CV syllables (\"foo, fee\"), approximations were closer to /f/ than last week, with fewer /p/ substitutions. Still required models and moderate cueing.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Given improved accuracy with /k/ in isolation, will continue to strengthen CV syllables and gradually increase practice at the word level in upcoming sessions.\n- For home, suggested Mom pick 3–4 “final sound” words (e.g., up, pop, map) and play quick turn-taking games, modeling clear final sounds and praising any attempts.\n- Plan to continue shaping /f/ and monitor readiness to move /k/ into more consistent word-level practice."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\nMom reported that over the past week he started saying \"car\" and \"cow\" with a clearer \"back sound\" at times, especially when reminded. She noted that some words are much clearer with family members, but unfamiliar listeners still ask for repetition. She feels he is more aware of when he is \"not quite right\" and sometimes tries again on his own.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient came into the therapy room independently and chose activities quickly. He was highly engaged in turn-taking games and tolerated short drill periods between play turns. Attention and cooperation were good, with minimal need for redirection. He responded well to specific praise.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) /k/ initial at word level (CVC words)\n- Focused on initial /k/ words (\"car, key, cow, cat, coat, cup\") at the imitated word level. Accuracy was much stronger this week, with many clear /k/ productions when given a model and brief cue to “lift the back of the tongue.”\n- Introduced simple carrier phrase \"my ___\" (\"my car,\" \"my cow\") with supported imitation. He was able to maintain /k/ in some phrase attempts, though accuracy decreased compared to single words.\n\n2) /k/ in isolation and syllables (maintenance)\n- Briefly revisited /k/ in isolation and CV syllables to warm up. He produced consistent /k/ in isolation and in simple syllables with minimal cueing, suggesting this level is becoming solid.\n\n3) Final consonant production in CVC words (/p, m, t/)\n- Continued with picture-based drill in a game format. At the imitated word level, he included final consonants more consistently than in prior weeks, particularly for /p/ and /m/ (e.g., \"map, mop, pop\"), with occasional omissions.\n- For final /t/ (\"hat, mat, boat\"), there were more variable productions, with some omissions or added vowels (“ha-tuh”). Using a slow model and tapping for the last sound helped him approximate final /t/ more clearly.\n\n4) Initial /f/ in CV syllables and simple words\n- Practiced /f/ in CV syllables (\"fee, foo, fah\") and introduced a small set of words (\"fish, fun, four\") in imitation. When cued to \"bite your lip and blow,\" he produced a recognizable /f/ much of the time, though occasional /p/ substitutions persisted.\n- He benefited from watching the clinician’s mouth in the mirror and seemed to enjoy “blowing the windy sound” to move small paper pieces.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Given the noticeable jump in /k/ accuracy at the word level, plan to continue /k/ initial words and gradually increase short carrier phrases next session.\n- For home practice, encouraged Mom to use a few /k/ words (car, cow, key) during daily routines, modeling clearly and inviting him to “try the back sound,” but without pressure.\n- Continue work on final consonants, especially final /t/, and support emerging /f/ accuracy."

She still hears many dropped final sounds but feels they are “popping in” more often. No concerns with hearing or overall health this week.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned smoothly and was eager to show the clinician his toy car. He remained engaged in structured tasks for longer stretches and responded well to visual schedules. Some mild distractibility toward the end of the session but generally cooperative and motivated.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) /k/ initial at word and carrier phrase level\n- Continued practice of initial /k/ words (\"car, cup, cat, coat, key, cow\") in imitation. Accuracy at the word level remained strong overall, with mostly clear /k/ productions when given a model and light cueing.\n- Expanded practice in short carrier phrases (\"my car,\" \"big cat,\" \"go car\") at the imitated phrase level. He was able to maintain the /k/ in many phrase attempts, although accuracy decreased when the phrase length increased or when attention waned.\n\n2) /k/ in simple two-word combinations in play\n- During structured play, the clinician modeled and elicited short two-word combinations (e.g., \"push car,\" \"blue cup\") with picture support. With modeling, he produced several accurate attempts, though some reverted to /t/ (“push tar”).\n\n3) Final consonant production (CVC: /p, m, t/)\n- Continued work with picture cards in a turn-taking game. Final /p/ and /m/ were present in many imitated trials; final /t/ remained more inconsistent, with a mix of clear productions, omissions, and added vowels.\n- He showed increased awareness, sometimes pausing and attempting to “add the end” after a reminder.\n\n4) Initial /f/ in words\n- Practiced initial /f/ words (\"fish, four, fun, food\") in imitation. When visually cued to bite his lower lip and blow, he produced several clear /f/ sounds, but still needed consistent reminders.\n- In spontaneous play language, /f/ was not yet observed without cueing.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating /k/ at the phrase level next session, with a mix of high-success words and some new items.\n- Maintain focus on final consonants, particularly final /t/, using simple games at home (e.g., emphasizing \"hat,\" \"feet\" in books).\n- Encourage parents to model short two-word phrases with /k/ words and praise any attempts to copy, without correcting every error."

He demonstrated good participation in both play-based and more structured activities. He tolerated brief drill tasks and seemed proud when praised for “strong sounds.” Mild fatigue at the very end of session.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) /k/ initial in carrier phrases and short sentences\n- Practiced /k/ words in simple carrier phrases (\"I see ___,\" \"my ___,\" \"go ___\") at the imitated phrase level. He was able to maintain /k/ in many phrases with a model, although accuracy still dropped when phrases were longer or when he spoke quickly.\n- Trialed short, repetitive sentences (\"I see a cat,\" \"I see a car\") in a picture book. He produced some accurate /k/ sounds in this context but required models and occasional segmenting.\n\n2) /k/ in structured play, emerging spontaneous use\n- During play with cars and animals, the clinician modeled /k/ words and encouraged him to request items (e.g., \"car please,\" \"cow please\"). He produced several imitated phrases with correct /k/ and a few more independent attempts with variable accuracy.\n\n3) Final consonants in CVC words\n- Continued practice with final /p, m, t/ in a picture game. Accuracy was similar to last week: final /p/ and /m/ were often present in imitation; final /t/ remained more variable.\n- He benefited from a visual of three “sound dots” to highlight beginning, middle, and end sounds and responded well to reminders to “tap the last dot.”\n\n4) Initial /f/ in words and CV syllables\n- Reviewed /f/ in CV syllables and practiced initial /f/ words (\"fish, four, fun, feet\"). Accuracy remained at a similar level to last session: he could produce clear /f/ with visual and verbal cues but rarely did so without support.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to work on stabilizing /k/ in short phrases and simple sentences next session, aiming for more consistent accuracy.\n- Maintain current final consonant and /f/ targets, as skills are emerging but not yet ready for the next level.\n- For home, encouraged Mom to highlight /k/ words during shared book reading and to pause for him to try, praising effort and any clear productions."

Accuracy remains variable but clearly improved relative to last session.\n\n2) Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)\n- Child demonstrated better control for /s/ in isolation when given a mirror and “teeth together, tongue behind teeth” cues, holding the sound briefly in several trials.\n- At CV syllables, there were more approximations of \"see\" and \"soo\" today, although distortions and /t/ substitutions still occurred frequently.\n- Child attended well to auditory bombardment and enjoyed the “snake sound” game, indicating increased awareness of the target.\n\n3) Final consonants in CVC words (imitation with cues)\n- Focused on final /p/ and /m/ in high-interest words (e.g., \"map, mop, pop, mom\").\n- With simultaneous productions and hand-tapping cues, child marked final consonants more often than last week; still omits many in less-supported attempts.\n- When the clinician exaggerated the final sound and paused, the child occasionally attempted to add the ending independently.\n\n4) Syllable shapes / multisyllabic words in play\n- Continued to hear consistent CV and CVCV patterns.\n- In imitation, child attempted \"banana\" and \"butterfly\" with 2–3 syllables marked, though consonant clarity was reduced.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue at current levels, as gains are emerging but not yet solid.\n- Keep practicing /f/ and /s/ in isolation and CV syllables, gradually increasing word-level trials where accuracy is higher.\n- Home practice: caregiver to play a short “snake sound” game (long /s/) and “bite and blow” game (/f/) once per day, praising any close approximations.\n- Next session: consider adding a few initial /f/ and /s/ words into simple play routines while maintaining high cueing support."

This indicates early carryover from imitation to more independent use.\n\n2) Initial /s/ in syllables and simple words (imitation)\n- Child produced /s/ in isolation more reliably and was able to hold the sound for several seconds with support.\n- At CV syllables (\"see, soo, sah\"), child produced more consistent /s/ on the first attempt, with fewer /t/ substitutions.\n- Introduced a small set of initial /s/ words (\"sun, sock, soap, soup\") at the imitated word level. Child produced several close approximations; occasional distortions and substitutions persisted but overall accuracy was improved compared to prior sessions.\n\n3) Final consonants in CVC words (imitation, emerging independence)\n- Continued work on final /p, m, t/ using picture cards and hand-tapping cues.\n- Child is beginning to mark final consonants more frequently when cued and sometimes attempted to add the ending after the clinician paused.\n- A few independent productions with audible final /p/ and /m/ were observed in play, though not yet consistent.\n\n4) Multisyllabic words in imitation\n- Practiced 2–3 syllable words (e.g., \"banana, bunny, pizza\"). Child marked most syllables but sometimes reduced consonants.\n- With clapping and segmenting, child could approximate full word shapes more clearly.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Expand practice of initial /f/ and /s/ at the imitated word level, while continuing to reinforce accurate isolation and syllable-level productions.\n- Maintain focus on final consonants in CVC words, aiming for more consistent marking with cues.\n- Home practice: caregiver to pick 3–4 favorite /f/ and /s/ words (e.g., fish, fun, sun, soap) and model them in short phrases (“fish in water,” “soap on hands”), praising any attempts at beginning or end sounds.\n- Next session: consider adding very simple carrier phrases (e.g., “my ___”) for high-accuracy /f/ or /s/ words if consistency remains strong."

She reported frequent omissions of sounds at the ends of words and difficulty with /k/ and /s/ sounds. No major changes since the evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned into the room with some hesitation but warmed up quickly with preferred toys. He was generally cheerful and cooperative, with short attention to tabletop tasks; needed occasional redirection from self-directed play back to structured practice.\n\nGoals and session observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, m, t/)\n- Targeted final consonants in simple CVC words (e.g., “cup, map, cat”) at the imitated word level.\n- Client frequently omitted final consonants or replaced them with a neutral vowel (e.g., “cu_,” “ma_”).\n- With maximal verbal cueing (e.g., “stop your sound,” “close your lips at the end”) and visual support, he produced clearer final consonants in a small number of trials, but consistency was low.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in syllables and simple words\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation and CV syllables (“koo, kah, kee”) using a “back sound” cue and mirror.\n- Client tended to substitute /t/ for /k/ (“tea” for “key”).\n- With hand-under-chin tactile cue and slowed rate, he achieved a few accurate /k/ sounds in isolation and in CV syllables; accuracy dropped when moving to CVC words (e.g., “cat, car”).\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Introduced /s/ as a “long, quiet snake sound.”\n- In isolation, client could approximate /s/ intermittently but often added a vowel (“suh”) or changed to /ʃ/.\n- In CV syllables (e.g., “see, soo”), he required maximal verbal and visual cueing; productions were mostly distorted or stopped.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- During play, modeled and elicited CV and CVCV (reduplicated) forms (e.g., “moo, baa, baba, mama”).\n- Client produced many CV and CVCV reduplicated forms spontaneously; accuracy decreased in alternating CVCV (e.g., “nana” for “banana”).\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue weekly therapy focusing on final consonants in CVC words and establishing /k/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables.\n- Home practice: encourage “stop your sound” at the end of words like “up, in, out,” praising any attempts to mark final sounds; model slow, clear speech during play. Provide caregiver with picture list of 5 CVC words to model, not to drill."

He was engaged with turn-taking games and tolerated short periods of structured drill between play activities. Needed light reminders to stay at the table but responded well to visual schedules.\n\nGoals and session observations:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words (/p, m, t/)\n- Practiced final /p, m, t/ at imitated word level (e.g., “cup, map, mat, ham”).\n- Compared to last session, he marked final consonants more often when provided with a model plus verbal cue (“close your lips,” “tap your tongue”).\n- Still omitted final sounds in spontaneous speech, but during practice trials he produced clearer final consonants in roughly half of the opportunities with moderate cueing.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV/CVC\n- Continued to work on /k/ in isolation using tongue-back imagery and mirror.\n- Client produced more accurate /k/ sounds in isolation with moderate cueing and less need for hand-under-chin support.\n- At CV level (“koo, key, kah”), he was able to imitate more consistent /k/ productions, though he often reverted to /t/ at the CVC word level (e.g., “tat” for “cat”).\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV\n- Reintroduced /s/ with “snake sound” visuals.\n- Client produced several accurate /s/ sounds in isolation when given clear modeling and time to shape the sound.\n- In CV syllables (“see, so, sue”), productions were slightly clearer than last week but remained inconsistent; he required maximal cueing to avoid adding a vowel (“suh”).\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CVCV alternating)\n- Targeted alternating CVCV words (e.g., “nana/banana, baby, bunny”) in play.\n- Client attempted these words more frequently and showed increased willingness to imitate longer words.\n- Accuracy of all syllables remained variable; he often reduced to CVCV reduplicated forms (“nana” for “banana”).\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on final consonants and /k/ at syllable and simple word levels; maintain early work on /s/ in isolation.\n- Home practice: 5–10 short practice trials of final /p/ and /m/ during daily routines (e.g., “up, nap”), using gentle reminders and lots of praise for any final sound attempts. Caregiver encouraged to notice and comment positively when he marks a final sound, even if it is not perfect."

Attention to tasks improved; he was able to participate in slightly longer practice blocks when activities were embedded in games. Mild silliness at times but easily redirected with clear expectations.\n\nGoals and session observations:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words (/p, m, t, n/)\n- Expanded CVC targets to include final /n/ (e.g., “sun, man”).\n- Client showed increased consistency in marking final /p/ and /m/ at the imitated word level with moderate verbal and visual cues.\n- For /t/ and /n/, accuracy was emerging but less stable; he sometimes substituted or omitted these sounds.\n- Noted occasional independent final consonant use during play (e.g., “up!” “in!”) without direct prompting.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CV and CVC words\n- Practiced /k/ in CV syllables and moved into a small set of CVC words (“car, cat, key, cow”).\n- Client produced more accurate /k/ in CV combinations with light cueing, needing fewer reminders to use his “back sound.”\n- At the CVC level, he produced several accurate imitations (e.g., “car”) but still reverted to /t/ in spontaneous attempts; overall, fewer substitutions than in previous sessions.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV\n- Continued shaping /s/ in isolation, then CV syllables.\n- Client was able to hold a clearer /s/ in isolation for longer durations with clinician model.\n- CV productions (“see, so, sue”) were somewhat more intelligible; still a tendency to add a vowel (“suh”) or distort, but he needed slightly fewer cues for correct tongue placement.\n\n4. Early /s/ blends (awareness only)\n- Introduced listening task with /s/ blends (e.g., “stop” vs. “top”) using minimal pairs.\n- Client demonstrated emerging awareness by pointing to the correct picture more often when the clinician emphasized the /s/.\n- No expectation for accurate production at this time; focus was auditory discrimination.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue strengthening final consonant production and /k/ in simple words; maintain work on /s/ in isolation and CV. Continue auditory discrimination for /s/ blends.\n- Home practice: model and practice a short list of final /p, m/ words during daily routines; introduce a simple listening game at home (“Did I say top or stop?”) to build awareness of /s/ blends without pressure to say them correctly."

            "note_text": "Parent/caregiver report:\nMom reported that she and Dad notice that others still have difficulty understanding Client, especially with words that start with /s/ and /f/. She shared that Client is starting junior kindergarten in the fall and they would like him to be easier to understand by teachers and peers.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned to the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from Mom with reassurance. He was generally cooperative and engaged with preferred toys (cars, animals). Attention to adult-directed tasks was fair; he needed frequent reminders to look at the clinician and to wait for his turn to speak.\n\nGoals and session observations:\n1. Establish /f/ in isolation and initial position\n- Baseline probing completed for /f/ in isolation and at the initial word level. Client was inconsistently able to produce a clear /f/ in isolation, often substituting /p/ or /b/ or adding a vowel (\"fuh\"). With maximal verbal cues (\"bite your lip and blow\") and visual modeling, he could approximate /f/ in isolation in some attempts.\n- At the imitated word level (e.g., \"fish, fun, four\"), accuracy was low; most productions were stopped (e.g., \"pish\" for \"fish\").\n\n2. Establish /s/ in isolation and initial position\n- Baseline assessment for /s/ in isolation and initial word position. Client was able to imitate a prolonged /s/ in isolation intermittently when given direct visual cues to smile and keep the tongue behind the teeth. Productions were often distorted or backed, and he occasionally substituted /d/.\n- At the imitated word level (e.g., \"sun, soup, see\"), productions were inconsistent and often reduced or changed to /d/ or /t/.\n\n3. Syllable shape inventory (CV, CVC, CVCV)\n- Informal sampling showed that Client used a variety of syllable shapes in play, including CV, CVC, and some CVCV (e.g., \"mama, dada, bunny\"). Final consonants were sometimes omitted in spontaneous speech, particularly for /t/ and /k/.\n\n4. Overall speech intelligibility in play\n- During unstructured play, Client used many 2–4 word phrases (e.g., \"my car go,\" \"I want that one\"). Intelligibility to the clinician unfamiliar with his speech was reduced, with frequent need for repetition and clarification. Mom was able to interpret many of his intended words based on context.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Begin direct treatment on /f/ and /s/ at the isolation and simple syllable level next session.\n- Encourage Mom to model clear /f/ and /s/ words in everyday routines (e.g., \"fish, food, soap, sun\") without pressuring Client to repeat.\n- Continue to monitor overall intelligibility and syllable shapes as we build sound accuracy.\n- Plan weekly sessions to support sound establishment prior to school entry."

She notices Client will sometimes try to copy her when she exaggerates her sounds, especially animal sounds and \"ffff\" for pretending to blow. She reports continued difficulty for extended family to understand him on the phone.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient entered the room more easily today and separated from Mom without distress. He was curious and talkative, frequently labeling toys. Attention was variable; he needed redirection when he became silly or started making sound effects instead of target words.\n\nGoals and session observations:\n1. /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced /f/ in isolation using a mirror and blowing activities (e.g., blowing pretend candles). With direct modeling and verbal cueing to \"bite lip and blow,\" Client produced a recognizable /f/ in isolation much more consistently than last session.\n- Introduced CV syllables (\"fa, fo, fee, foo\"). Accuracy was emerging; he often added a vowel (\"fuh\") or slipped back to /p/. With moderate cues, he was able to approximate several correct productions in a row.\n\n2. /f/ in initial position of single words (imitation)\n- Targeted simple /f/ words (\"fish, fun, four, food\") at the imitated word level using picture cards. Accuracy remained inconsistent, but he demonstrated more attempts and some clearer /f/ at the beginning of words compared to baseline.\n- Needed frequent verbal reminders to keep his teeth on his lip and slow down. When given time and repeated models, he produced a few words clearly.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation\n- Focused on shaping a long, quiet /s/ in isolation with visual cues and use of a mirror. Client could produce a reasonable /s/ when he was attending and imitating slowly. He tended to shorten the sound or let his tongue come forward between his teeth without cues.\n- He responded well to the cue of “snake sound,” and was able to sustain /s/ for a few seconds on several attempts.\n\n4. Early awareness of /s/ and /f/ in play\n- During play, Client enjoyed making “snake” and “blowing” sounds. He imitated /s/ and /f/ in isolation in the context of games (e.g., feeding the snake, blowing pretend bubbles). These were mostly cued, but he showed interest and enjoyment.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on establishing consistent /f/ and /s/ in isolation and CV syllables next session.\n- Encourage family to play “snake sound” and “blowing” games at home, praising all attempts without correcting too frequently.\n- Consider moving to more consistent word-level practice for /f/ once accuracy in CV syllables becomes more stable."

He was highly talkative, occasionally rushing and talking over the clinician. He responded well to structured games and visual supports, with fewer redirections needed compared to earlier sessions.\n\nGoals and session observations:\n1. /f/ in isolation and CV/CVC syllables\n- Client produced /f/ in isolation with good consistency today when given a brief verbal reminder. He needed fewer physical prompts and was able to self-correct some /p/ substitutions after a model.\n- Practiced CV syllables (\"fee, foo, fa, fo\") and simple CVC syllables (\"fuh, faf\") using picture cues and turn-taking games. Accuracy for CV syllables improved compared to last week, with several correct productions in a row when he slowed down. CVC was more challenging but showed some emerging accuracy.\n\n2. /f/ initial at single word level (imitation)\n- Targeted initial /f/ words (\"fish, four, fun, fan, feet\") at the imitated word level. Compared to previous sessions, Client produced a clearer /f/ at the beginning of words more frequently, though he still occasionally reverted to /p/.\n- With moderate verbal cueing and a visual reminder card, he was able to imitate many of the words accurately in structured tasks. He began to anticipate the cue and sometimes corrected himself mid-word.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on /s/ in isolation, then introduced /s/ in CV syllables (\"see, so, sa\"). Client demonstrated more consistent production of a quiet, sustained /s/ in isolation, especially when cued with “snake sound” and a visual of a snake.\n- CV syllables were variable; he occasionally produced /sh/ or allowed his tongue to come forward. With repeated models and slowing down, he was able to produce some accurate CV syllables.\n\n4. Beginning /s/ initial words (imitation)\n- Briefly probed simple /s/ words (\"sun, soup, sock\") in imitation. Accuracy was limited but better than baseline; several attempts contained an emerging /s/ rather than a stop.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen /f/ initial at the word level, aiming for more consistent accuracy before moving into phrases.\n- Continue building /s/ accuracy in isolation and CV, gradually increasing the number of /s/ words.\n- Encourage parents to model and emphasize /f/ in common words (\"food, fun, feet\") and praise Client when they hear even partial improvements.\n- Consider incorporating simple carrier phrases (\"my ___\") for /f/ words once word-level accuracy is more reliable."

She notes that this doesn’t happen all the time, but she is hearing more clear /f/ at the start of a few familiar words.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient arrived in a cheerful mood and transitioned independently. He engaged well in structured tabletop tasks and enjoyed earning stickers for “best sounds.” Attention and cooperation were good, with brief periods of silliness that were easily redirected.\n\nGoals and session observations:\n1. /f/ initial at single word level (imitation → faded cues)\n- Focused on a set of familiar /f/ words (\"fish, feet, four, fun, fan, food\"). Client demonstrated noticeably improved accuracy compared to the previous week. With an initial model and light verbal cue, he produced many of the targets clearly.\n- Began fading cues: when given only a picture prompt, Client was often able to produce an intelligible /f/ at the beginning of the word. He occasionally slipped back to /p/, but corrected himself on some trials when the clinician repeated the word.\n\n2. /f/ initial in simple carrier phrases (imitation)\n- Introduced carrier phrases such as \"my ___\" and \"I see ___\" with /f/ target words (e.g., \"my fish,\" \"I see feet\"). At this level, Client required more support and direct modeling, but was able to imitate the phrases with a recognizable /f/ in many attempts.\n- He tended to rush through the phrase, so slowing the rate and tapping each word improved clarity.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued structured practice of /s/ in isolation, with Client demonstrating increased consistency using the “snake sound” cue. He could hold the sound for several seconds on multiple trials.\n- Practiced /s/ CV syllables (\"see, so, sa, sue\") with moderate success. Distortions and occasional /sh/ substitutions were still present, but there was an overall improvement in his ability to produce a more accurate /s/ at the start of the syllable.\n\n4. Initial /s/ words (imitation, brief)\n- Used picture cards for words such as \"sun, soup, sock, soap.\" Client imitated these with mixed accuracy; however, compared to earlier probes, more attempts contained a reasonable /s/ rather than a stop consonant.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to practice /f/ at the word level with reduced cues and expand phrase-level practice as tolerated.\n- Maintain focus on /s/ in isolation and CV syllables to solidify the sound before moving heavily into word-level practice.\n- Home practice: encourage short daily practice with 3–5 /f/ words using a picture chart; parents to praise any self-corrections.\n- Plan to introduce more consistent phrase-level /f/ and increase the variety of /s/ words over the next 1–2 sessions."

She has not noticed much change in his /s/ yet in conversation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient separated easily and eagerly chose the therapy activities. He showed good participation in structured tasks and tolerated repetition well. Mild distractibility was observed when tasks became more challenging, but he responded to breaks and reinforcement.\n\nGoals and session observations:\n1. /f/ initial at word level (imitation and picture prompts)\n- Client continued to show strong performance with initial /f/ words in imitation (\"fish, four, feet, five, fun, fan, food\"). He needed minimal cueing for most words and maintained fairly consistent accuracy.\n- When provided only a picture prompt and asked to name the item, he was able to produce /f/ correctly in many instances, though occasional /p/ substitutions persisted.\n\n2. /f/ initial in short carrier phrases (imitation → partial independence)\n- Practiced phrases such as \"my fish,\" \"I see feet,\" \"big fan\" using a turn-taking game. Client could imitate these phrases clearly when modeled.\n- With faded models (clinician starting the phrase, then pausing), he often filled in the /f/ word with a clear /f/. In a few trials, he independently produced a phrase with accurate /f/ without any model, especially for highly familiar words.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on /s/ isolation and CV syllables. Client maintained improved consistency with a sustained /s/ when fully focused. He still required reminders to keep his tongue behind his teeth.\n- CV syllables (\"see, so, say, sue\") showed gradual improvement; he produced a more accurate /s/ in a greater proportion of attempts than previous sessions, although some distortions remained.\n\n4. Initial /s/ words (imitation)\n- Targeted a small set of /s/ words (\"sun, soup, sock, soap, seal\") in imitation. Accuracy was modest but showed some improvement; more productions contained a clear initial /s/ rather than a stop.\n- He continued to benefit from visual cues (pointing to the teeth and smiling) and slowed pacing.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Maintain current focus: consolidate /f/ in words and simple phrases, and continue to build /s/ in isolation/CV and limited word-level practice.\n- Home practice: encourage Client to use his “good /f/ sound” in routine phrases (e.g., \"my food,\" \"my fish\") with gentle reminders.\n- Monitor readiness to increase phrase-level independence for /f/ and expand the /s/ word list over the next sessions."

Attention was sustained for longer stretches, and he was proud of his successes.\n\nGoals and session observations:\n1. /f/ initial in single words and short phrases (increasing independence)\n- Client produced initial /f/ words with high accuracy in imitation and with picture prompts alone (\"fish, four, five, feet, fun, fan, food, fork\"). He required only occasional reminders when he became excited and rushed.\n- In short phrases (\"my fish,\" \"I see food,\" \"funny feet\"), Client was able to imitate accurately and, in many trials, produced the phrases with only a picture cue and a verbal starter (e.g., \"my ___\"). Several spontaneous phrases with clear /f/ were heard during play (e.g., \"funny fish,\" \"my food\"), indicating growing independence.\n\n2. Trial /f/ in simple sentences (imitation)\n- Briefly trialed short sentences containing /f/ words (e.g., \"The fish is big,\" \"I see four fish\").

Short /s/ phrases (imitation)\n- Continued practice with simple phrases (\"my socks,\" \"see sun,\" \"sick soup,\" \"sad seal\"). Client imitated these with fair success when given a slow, segmented model. He still required this level of support for consistent accuracy.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Maintain current approach: /f/ primarily monitored, /s/ targeted directly.\n- For /s/: continue building consistency at the word level, and maintain supported phrase practice. Consider gradually increasing the variety of /s/ words as accuracy allows.\n- Home practice: encourage caregivers to highlight and praise Client’s attempts to self-correct /s/ and to keep practice playful and brief.\n- Next session will revisit similar /s/ targets, watching for any natural increases in independence."

            "note_text": "Parent/caregiver report:\nMom stated that overall she is very pleased with Client’s progress in being understood by family and teachers. She continues to hear strong /f/ in his everyday speech and feels his /s/ is \"slowly getting better,\" with more good \"snake sounds\" when he is calm and focused.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient arrived in good spirits and appeared confident. He followed the therapy routine with minimal prompts and participated well in structured and play-based tasks. He enjoyed reviewing his “old” /f/ words and practicing his “new” /s/ words.\n\nGoals and session observations:\n1. /f/ in conversation (ongoing maintenance)\n- Throughout the session, Client used accurate /f/ in conversation and structured activities without any direct prompts. He produced /f/ clearly in a range of words (\"food, fish, fun, four, five, phone\") and in short sentences.\n- No notable regression was observed; skills appear stable and well-maintained.\n\n2. /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Brief warm-up with sustained /s/ and CV syllables. Client continued to produce a clear /s/ most of the time with minimal verbal reminders. Occasional distortions were present but quickly corrected.\n\n3. Initial /s/ words (imitation and picture naming)\n- Practiced a set of initial /s/ words (\"sun, sock, soup, soap, sand, sit, same, sad, sick, seed, soda\") in a game format. In imitation, Client achieved similar accuracy to recent sessions, with many clear productions when he watched the clinician’s model.\n- In independent naming, he produced a mix of accurate and approximate /s/ words. Performance was largely consistent with previous weeks, reflecting ongoing consolidation at this level.\n\n4. Simple /s/ phrases (imitation)\n- Revisited short phrases (\"my socks,\" \"see sun,\" \"sad seal,\" \"sick soup\") at the imitation level. Client continued to be able to imitate these with fair accuracy when given a slow model and segmenting.\n- Independence at the phrase level for /s/ remains an emerging skill and an appropriate focus for continued therapy.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue weekly therapy to support further development of /s/ at the word and phrase levels while monitoring maintained /f/ gains.\n- Home practice: caregivers to continue short daily practice with 3–5 /s/ words and 1–2 simple /s/ phrases, emphasizing the “snake sound” and praising all attempts.\n- Consider future introduction of more varied /s/ contexts (e.g., medial and final positions, blends) once initial /s/ becomes more consistent.\n- Maintain ongoing communication with preschool staff regarding Client’s speech sound progress and strategies that support his clarity in the classroom."

Establish /k/ in isolation\n- Practiced \"back sound\" /k/ with use of tongue depressor for placement, mirror, and verbal cues (\"tongue up and back\").\n- Child was able to approximate /k/ in isolation inconsistently; productions frequently backed toward a glottal sound or shifted to /t/.\n- Needed maximal verbal and visual cueing; no independent productions yet.\n\n2. /k/ initial in simple CV syllables (e.g., \"kee, koo, kah\")\n- Attempted after isolation practice.\n- Child often substituted /t/ (\"tee\" for \"kee\").\n- A few clearer approximations emerged when paired with exaggerated mouth models and slowed rate; accuracy remained low overall.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation\n- Introduced \"long, quiet air\" /s/ using snake imagery and mirror.\n- Child could briefly hold airflow but often added a voice or changed placement to /sh/ or /th/-like sounds.\n- Required hand-over-hand cueing for airflow and lip retraction; no consistent independent /s/ yet.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Observed and elicited a variety of simple syllable shapes in play (e.g., \"boo,\" \"mama,\" \"nana\").\n- Child produced CV and reduplicated CVCV forms easily; some difficulty with alternating CVCV (e.g., \"bunny\" became \"buh-buh\").\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to establish /k/ and /s/ at isolation and simple syllable levels before moving to words.\n- Encourage parent to model slow, clear productions during daily routines without pressure for child to repeat.\n- Provide parent with simple visuals (snake for /s/, \"back sound\" picture for /k/) and demonstrate how to praise any attempts at these sounds.\n- Next session: continue placement work for /k/ and /s/ and begin probing for /k/ in a small set of high-interest words if ready."

No formal home practice yet.\n- Parent shared that child is beginning junior kindergarten in the fall and they would like speech to be clearer for teachers and peers.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child transitioned willingly to therapy room with mom, briefly shy but warmed up within a few minutes.\n- Enjoyed pretend play with farm animals and cars. Needed occasional redirection from self-directed play back to practice tasks, but responded well to visual supports and simple choices.\n\nGoals / Session Targets:\n1. Baseline for overall speech sound production\n- Collected informal speech sample in play and picture naming.\n- Noted consistent difficulty with /s/ blends (e.g., “lide” for “slide,” “top” for “stop”), initial /f/ (“pish” for “fish”), and some distortions/substitutions for /sh/ (often closer to /s/).\n- Final consonants for /p, m, t/ present in most words; occasional omissions when speaking quickly.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in isolation and syllables\n- Introduced /f/ sound with visual cue for “biting lip and blowing air.”\n- In isolation, child produced /f/ correctly with simultaneous modeling in about half of attempts; tended to substitute /p/ or omit airflow.\n- In simple syllables (e.g., “foo, fah, fee”), accuracy decreased; required maximal verbal and visual cueing and slowed rate.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Practiced “snake sound” /s/ with mirror.\n- In isolation, child approximated /s/ but often added a brief vowel (“suh”). With verbal reminder to “keep tongue behind teeth and no voice,” was able to hold a closer /s/ for a few seconds in several attempts.\n- In CV syllables (e.g., “see, soo”), child often produced /d/ or /z/; success improved when clinician modeled slowly and used hand cue for “long sound.”\n\n4. Initial /sh/ in isolation\n- Introduced /sh/ as “quiet sound.” Child tended to produce /s/ instead.\n- With modeling and cue to round lips, child could approximate /sh/ in isolation intermittently, but not yet stable.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to build awareness of /f/, /s/, and /sh/ at isolation and simple syllable level before moving into words.\n- Suggested parent model “fish,” “feet,” and “fun” during play and mealtimes, emphasizing lip placement and airflow without asking for constant imitation.\n- Next session: further probe /s/ blends and initial /f/ at word level to refine targets; introduce simple picture cards for structured practice."

She notices child is starting to copy her slow models sometimes when she emphasizes /f/ words (\"fish,\" \"four\").\n- Parent expressed interest in ideas to practice sounds during daily routines without making child frustrated.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child separated from mom easily and eagerly showed clinician a new toy car.\n- Good participation overall; occasional silliness (giggling, making animal noises) when tasks became more challenging. Responded to short movement breaks and then returned to table activities.\n\nGoals / Session Targets:\n1. Initial /f/ – isolation and CV/CVC syllables\n- Reviewed /f/ in isolation using mirror and feather-blowing game. Child produced a clear /f/ in isolation with direct model in most attempts, still needing reminders to keep lips together.\n- In CV syllables (\"fee, foo, fah\"), accuracy slightly improved compared to last week with clinician support. Some productions still stopped to /p/ (\"pee\" for \"fee\"), especially when excited.\n- Introduced a few CVC syllables (\"foof,\" \"fif\") at imitation level; accuracy was low but child attempted willingly.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in isolation and syllables\n- Practiced sustained /s/ using a \"snake race\" visual. Child could hold a relatively steady /s/ for short durations in multiple trials when cued to \"keep teeth together\" and \"no voice.\"\n- CV syllables (\"see, soo, sah\"): still inconsistent; substitutions of /d/ and /z/ observed. Slightly better accuracy when clinician used a whisper model and hand cue for \"long sound.\"\n\n3. Initial /sh/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Reviewed /sh/ as \"quiet sound.\" Child continued to favor /s/; however, with lip rounding cue and auditory contrast between /s/ and /sh/, child achieved closer /sh/ productions in several isolated attempts.\n- Tried a few CV syllables (\"shoe, she\"); child needed maximal modeling and often reverted to /s/.\n\n4. Probe /s/ blends at word level (imitation)\n- Briefly probed \"stop, spin, slide\" in imitation. Child consistently reduced blends (e.g., \"top,\" \"bin,\" \"lide\").\n- Able to identify which word clinician said in a minimal pair (\"stop/top\") more often than not, suggesting emerging awareness even though production is not yet established.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Skills appear similar to initial session but with slightly more consistent attempts and awareness.\n- Continue focusing on stabilizing /f/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables; keep /sh/ and /s/ blends as short probes.\n- Encouraged parent to use short, playful modeling of /f/ words during bath time and meals, praising any close attempts without correcting every error.\n- Next session: consider moving /f/ into a small set of high-interest words if accuracy in syllables continues to improve."

Needed mild encouragement to attempt more challenging words but did not refuse.\n\nGoals / Session Targets:\n1. Initial /f/ – word level (imitation)\n- Moved /f/ into high-interest words (\"fish, feet, four, fun, fan, food\") at the imitated word level.\n- With a direct model and visual cue (lip bite + airflow), child produced initial /f/ accurately in the majority of trials; occasional /p/ substitutions persisted when speaking quickly.\n- Able to self-correct in some cases when clinician repeated the word with emphasis on /f/.\n\n2. Initial /f/ – emerging spontaneous use in play\n- During play-based activities (feeding toy animals, counting toys), child spontaneously used some /f/ words (\"fish, four\") with clearer /f/ than in previous sessions.\n- Not yet consistent, but several independent productions were noticeably more accurate without direct prompts.\n\n3. Initial /s/ – isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued practice with sustained /s/ using mirror and picture cues. Child maintained a more stable /s/ in multiple attempts, requiring fewer reminders about tongue placement.\n- CV syllables (\"see, soo, say\"): accuracy improved with slower rate and hand cue; fewer /d/ substitutions, though some productions remained distorted.\n\n4. Initial /sh/ – isolation\n- Briefly revisited /sh/; with cues for lip rounding and \"quiet air,\" child achieved closer approximations in a handful of trials.\n- Still not yet ready to move beyond isolation; will continue as a secondary target.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Notable improvement for initial /f/ at the word level this week; continue building consistency and begin fading visual cues.\n- Suggested parent focus on a small set of /f/ words at home (fish, four, fun, feet) in books and routines, praising clear attempts and modeling slowly.\n- Maintain work on /s/ in isolation and CV syllables; keep /sh/ as short practice with strong visual support.\n- Next session: expand initial /f/ to additional words and begin pairing /f/ words in short, imitated phrases if accuracy remains strong."

Short periods of distraction when tasks became repetitive, but able to re-engage with choices and brief breaks.\n\nGoals / Session Targets:\n1. Initial /f/ – word level (imitation and reduced cues)\n- Practiced a broader set of /f/ words (\"fish, fan, fun, feet, farm, phone, fork, five\") at the imitated word level.\n- Child produced initial /f/ accurately in most attempts with only light verbal reminders. Visual cues were faded for many trials.\n- Occasional /p/ substitutions occurred when rushing, but child often corrected after clinician modeled once more.\n\n2.

Initial /s/ – phrases and short sentences (imitation)\n- Practiced slightly longer phrases/sentences containing initial /s/ words (\"see the sun,\" \"sock on foot,\" \"soap in water\").\n- Child was able to maintain a clear /s/ in many imitated phrases with support for slow rate and modeling, though accuracy decreased when phrases became more complex.\n- Overall performance was similar to recent sessions, indicating continued consolidation at this level.\n\n2. Initial /s/ – spontaneous use in structured play\n- In play activities (dressing dolls, bath toy scene), child spontaneously used some /s/ words with clearer productions than in earlier sessions.\n- Not all spontaneous /s/ words were accurate, but child appeared more aware and occasionally attempted to fix productions after hearing clinician’s model.\n\n3. /s/ blends – imitated word level with segmentation\n- Targeted /s/ blends (\"stop, spin, slide, spoon, star, snow\") using segmented practice (\"s\" + \"top\").\n- Child continued to reduce blends in many attempts, but there were a few more evident attempts at two consonants, especially for /st/ words, even if not yet fully accurate.\n\n4. Initial /sh/ – isolation and simple words\n- Briefly revisited /sh/ in isolation and words (\"shoe, ship\").\n- Child produced a closer /sh/ in isolation with lip rounding cues, and had a few approximate productions in words when imitating slowly.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Performance this week largely mirrors prior sessions, with ongoing practice needed for stability at the phrase level for /s/.\n- Encouraged parent to continue modeling clear /s/ in short sentences during shared book reading (e.g., \"see the sun\") and to praise efforts rather than perfection.\n- Maintain focus on /s/ at phrase level and continue supported work on /s/ blends and occasional /sh/ practice.\n- Next session: continue current targets, monitoring for any natural increases in independence or consistency."

Initial /s/ – phrases and short sentences (imitation and partial independence)\n- Continued practice with phrases/sentences including initial /s/ words (\"see the sun,\" \"soap on hands,\" \"sock on foot\").\n- Accuracy and cueing needs were similar to recent weeks: many clear /s/ productions with moderate support, some with lighter cues.\n- Occasional independent phrase-level /s/ productions emerged during structured tasks, though not yet fully consistent.\n\n2. Initial /s/ – spontaneous productions\n- During play, child produced several spontaneous /s/ words, some with good clarity (\"sun,\" \"soap\"), others with residual distortions.\n- When provided with a natural model, child sometimes chose to repeat and refine the word.\n\n3. /s/ blends – highly supported production attempts\n- Practiced /s/ blends (\"stop, spin, slide, star, snow\") using segmentation and visual cues.\n- Child continued to show difficulty, with frequent reduction to single consonants. However, there were a few attempts where an initial /s/-like sound was produced before the following consonant.\n\n4. Initial /f/ – monitoring\n- In conversation, child’s initial /f/ remained clear and consistent across a range of words without direct cueing.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- This session reflected continued stability and gradual refinement of /s/ at the phrase level; blends remain an emerging area.\n- Recommended parent continue to draw attention to clear /s/ in meaningful contexts and briefly practice a few /s/ phrases in play.\n- Maintain focus on /s/ at the phrase/sentence level and continue brief, supported /s/ blend practice.\n- Next session: review progress over the block and discuss potential next steps with parent."

Initial /s/ – spontaneous use in play\n- During play, child used several /s/ words (\"sun, soap, sock, soup\") spontaneously, with a mix of accurate and approximate productions.\n- Child showed increased willingness to repeat and refine words when clinician modeled them naturally.\n\n3. /s/ blends – imitated word level\n- Continued targeted practice of /s/ blends (\"stop, spin, slide, spoon, star\") with segmentation and visual support.\n- Blends remained challenging; most productions still involved reduction, though there were isolated closer approximations (e.g., an audible /s/ followed by a somewhat blended second consonant) with maximal cueing.\n\n4. Initial /f/ – generalization check\n- Monitored /f/ in conversational speech and play.\n- Child consistently produced clear initial /f/ across a range of familiar and less familiar words without cues.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Skills this week reflect continued consolidation rather than a large shift: /f/ is well-established, /s/ shows improved but still variable accuracy at the phrase/sentence level, and /s/ blends remain an area for ongoing development.\n- Discussed with mother: recommend continued therapy with focus on refining initial /s/ in longer phrases and building accuracy for /s/ blends.\n- Provided home practice ideas: brief daily practice with 3–5 /s/ words in short sentences, and playful awareness activities for /s/ blends (listening games, slow segmented models) without pressuring for perfect production.\n- Plan for next block (if continuing): emphasize /s/ blends and increasing independence with /s/ in connected speech, while monitoring maintained gains for /f/."

No major changes since initial assessment.\n- Parent noted child is starting junior kindergarten in the fall and would like support for clearer speech in short phrases.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned with some hesitation but separated from parent with encouragement.\n- Once in the room, child engaged well in play-based tasks, responded to visual supports, and accepted clinician-led activities with brief redirections.\n- Attention span appropriate for age with occasional off-topic comments and silliness.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Establish production of /k/ in isolation and simple syllables (CV)\n- Baseline: Fronting observed (/t/ for /k/) in spontaneous speech (e.g., \"tat\" for \"cat\").\n- With direct modeling and visual cue (pointing to \"back sound\"), child produced /k/ in isolation inconsistently; able to achieve a clear /k/ in about half of attempts with maximal verbal and visual cueing.\n- In CV syllables (\"koo, kay, key\"), child often reverted to /t/; required simultaneous production with clinician and hand-to-throat cue to support placement.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Child often omitted or stopped /f/ to /p/ in conversation (e.g., \"pish\" for \"fish\").\n- In isolation, could approximate /f/ with strong visual model (\"bite lip, blow air\"); accuracy inconsistent, with frequent voicing or lip closure errors.\n- In CV syllables (\"fee, foo, faa\"), productions were mostly approximations, requiring repeated models and verbal reminders to use \"lip bite\" and quiet air.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation\n- Child produced /s/ with lateral airflow and occasional /sh/-like substitutions in spontaneous speech.\n- With mirror and snake visual, could produce a closer approximation of /s/ with significant support (verbal cueing for tongue placement and gentle airflow); accuracy low but some clear exemplars achieved.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CVC, CVCV) with clear consonant marking\n- During play, child produced a range of CVC and CVCV words but often reduced final consonants and altered target sounds.\n- With modeling and slowed rate, could mark some final consonants in imitation (e.g., \"cup,\" \"map\"), but needed frequent reminders and segmentation.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build foundational placement for /k/, /f/, and /s/ at isolation and simple syllable levels.\n- Encourage parent to model \"back sound\" /k/ during daily routines (e.g., \"car, cookie, coat\") without pressuring child to repeat.\n- Provide parent with simple cues for /f/ (\"bite lip, blow\") to use during book reading.\n- Next session: re-check stimulability for /k/ and /f/, and continue play-based CV/CVC practice with high modeling."

Initial /f/ in isolation and CV\n- Child more readily produced an identifiable /f/ in isolation with a mirror and \"lip bite\" cue; fewer substitutions to /p/ compared with last session.\n- In CV syllables (\"fee, foo, fa\"), approximations were closer to target; still needed reminders to keep lips gently together and use quiet air.\n- Parent education during session: demonstrated cueing strategy for parent to practice at home.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation\n- Continued work on tongue placement with mirror; child able to imitate a slightly clearer /s\" when focusing on \"smiling\" and keeping tongue behind teeth.\n- Accuracy improved slightly with verbal cues and hand signal for \"long, quiet sound,\" though productions remained inconsistent.\n\n4. CVC words with final consonant marking\n- Practiced simple CVC words in imitation (\"cup, map, sit, nap\") using picture cards.\n- Child marked final consonants more often than in previous session when syllables were segmented and rate was slowed; still omitted or weakened final sounds in spontaneous speech.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to solidify /k/ and /f/ in isolation and CV, and expand initial /k/ to imitated word level as tolerated.\n- Maintain focus on clear, slow models at home; encourage parent to praise attempts rather than correctness.\n- Provide a small set of picture cards (e.g., \"car, key, cup, fish, feet\") for home practice 3–5 minutes daily.\n- Next session: trial more consistent word-level practice for /k/ and /f/, and continue shaping /s/ with mirror work."

She hears clearer /k/ in \"car\" and \"cookie,\" but /k/ is still missing in some other words.\n- Parent shared that child is using more 4–5 word sentences at home.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned smoothly and participated readily in routine.\n- Engagement was good; enjoyed pretend play and was willing to pause to practice words.\n- Occasional distractibility but easily redirected.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Initial /k/ in words and structured phrases\n- Word-level /k/ remained accurate in imitation with minimal cueing across familiar vocabulary.\n- In structured phrases and short sentences (\"I see the car,\" \"my cat is big\"), child continued to produce /k/ with similar accuracy to prior sessions.\n- Spontaneous use of /k/ during play remained variable; no clear increase from last week.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in words and two-word phrases\n- Child maintained similar accuracy for initial /f/ in imitated words; minimal change noted.\n- Two-word phrases with /f/ (\"fun fish,\" \"fast fox\") were produced with similar levels of support and accuracy as in previous sessions.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV\n- Short practice segments for /s/ continued. Child was able to produce intermittent clear /s/ in isolation with maximal cueing, but inconsistency persisted.\n- CV syllables remained difficult, with frequent shifts to /sh/ or other approximations.\n\n4. Final consonants in CVC words\n- Practiced final /p, t, m, n/ in structured tasks. Child showed stable performance: clearer endings when given segmentation/tapping, but frequent omissions in connected speech.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue with current hierarchy levels, focusing on maintaining gains and gradually encouraging more independent /k/ and /f/ use in structured play.\n- Parent encouraged to model slow, clear speech and to emphasize target sounds within child’s longer sentences (e.g., repeating and expanding child’s utterances with clear /k/ and /f/).\n- Next session: maintain current targets; may begin planning for next block’s goals depending on stability of performance."

She notices he often leaves off sounds at the ends of words and sometimes says \"tup\" for \"cup\" or \"do\" for \"go.\" No major changes since the evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned with some hesitation but separated from mom with encouragement. Once in the room, he warmed up quickly and engaged well with toy cars and a farm set. Attention to adult-directed tasks was fair; needed frequent redirection from self-directed play but responded to visual supports and choices.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Establish production of /k/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation using \"cough\" and \"back sound\" cues. He was able to approximate the sound with maximal verbal and visual support (mirror, open-mouth posture) but frequently substituted /t/. \n- At CV level (e.g., \"ku,\" \"ki,\" \"ko\"), he produced a mix of accurate /k/ and fronted /t/, with better accuracy when the clinician provided simultaneous production and slowed rate.\n\n2) Initial /k/ at single-word level (imitation)\n- Target words: \"key, car, cow, cookie.\" At this time, productions were mostly imitated and often fronted to /t/ (e.g., \"tar\" for \"car\").\n- When he achieved a good /k/ in isolation immediately beforehand, he occasionally carried it into the word, but this was inconsistent and required heavy prompting.\n\n3) Final consonants (general awareness)\n- During play, clinician modeled CVC words with final /p, t, m/ (e.g., \"cup, hot, mom\") and drew attention to the \"sound at the end\" using visual cueing (tapping a picture).\n- Client rarely added final sounds independently; he repeated some CVC words after a model but often omitted the final consonant despite maximal cues.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build awareness of back sounds and final consonants at the isolation and simple syllable level.\n- Home practice: parent encouraged to practice \"back sound\" /k/ in front of a mirror with short \"ku\" and \"ki\" games, keeping it playful and brief (1–2 minutes). Emphasized focusing on correct attempts, not perfection.\n- Next session: continue /k/ in isolation and CV syllables; further probe final consonant production in high-interest words."

He was talkative and enjoyed pretend play with a garage and cars. Required some reminders to stay seated for structured drill but was generally cooperative and motivated by turn-taking games and stickers.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Showed a noticeable increase in accuracy for /k/ in isolation with visual cues (mirror, \"tongue back\" prompts). He produced a clearer /k/ more consistently than last week, often after a single model.\n- At CV level (\"ku, ki, ko\"), he produced more accurate /k/ productions, especially when the clinician used a slow rate and tapped his shoulder for the \"back\" sound. Fronting to /t/ still occurred, but he showed emerging self-correction when given time to repeat.\n\n2) Initial /k/ at imitated word level\n- Target words: \"car, key, cow, cookie, cat.\" Compared to last session, he had more successful imitations with clear /k/, particularly for \"car\" and \"cow\" when paired with picture cards.\n- Still needed moderate verbal cues (\"back sound\" and slowed rate), but he responded well to backward chaining (e.g., \"ar\" → \"car\").\n\n3) Final consonants (awareness and imitation)\n- Practiced CVC words with final /p, t, m/ in a picture game (\"cup, hat, mop, hot, mom\"). With direct imitation and pointing cues, he produced some final consonants more clearly than in the previous session.\n- Omission of final sounds remained frequent in spontaneous speech, but he tolerated cueing and was able to mark some final consonants in structured practice.\n\n4) Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Observed a variety of syllable shapes in play, including CV and CVCV (e.g., \"bunny,\" \"daddy\"). Longer words often had reduced clarity but most syllables were present.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue targeting /k/ in CV syllables and initial position at the word level, as he is demonstrating a positive response to cueing.\n- Maintain focus on final consonant awareness with high-interest CVC words.\n- Home practice: parent to choose 3–4 /k/ words (e.g., car, cow, cookie, key) and model slowly, encouraging him to copy when engaged; praise any attempts at the back sound.\n- Next session: continue current level; consider introducing simple phrase frames (\"my car\") if initial /k/ accuracy remains steady in imitation."

He maintained improved accuracy with these lighter supports.\n\n2) /k/ initial in short phrases (imitation and cued spontaneous)\n- Continued with carrier phrases such as \"my car,\" \"big cow,\" \"red cup,\" and \"go car\" using picture scenes.\n- He produced many phrases with a clear initial /k/ following a model. With gestural cueing and slower rate, he also attempted some phrases more independently during play (e.g., pointing and saying \"my car\").\n\n3) Final consonants /p, t, m/ in CVC words\n- Practiced final consonants with picture cards and a simple board game.

He continued to use clearer /k/ in favorite words; final consonant deletion and simplification patterns persisted.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating current skills; performance appears stable.\n- Home practice: encourage slow, clear productions of a few chosen CVC words with final /p/ and /m/, and continue to reinforce successful /k/ words.\n- Next session: maintain similar targets while monitoring for readiness to adjust approach to final consonant work (e.g., additional visual supports or different word sets)."

He was cooperative and generally attentive, though he occasionally attempted to rush through drill tasks. He responded well to brief movement breaks and visual cues for \"slow and clear.\"\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) /k/ initial at word and sentence levels (maintenance)\n- Reviewed familiar /k/ words and short sentences. Accuracy remained stable; he continued to produce a clear /k/ in most imitated contexts with light cueing.\n- Some independent correct /k/ productions were heard during play when labeling pictures and toys, consistent with previous sessions.\n\n2) Final consonants /p, t, m/ in CVC words\n- Continued with CVC practice using a board game format. He produced final /p/ and /m/ correctly in some imitated trials but still omitted these sounds frequently without direct prompting.\n- Final /t/ remained the most difficult; he required maximal verbal and visual cues to mark this sound at the end of words like \"hat\" and \"hot.\"\n\n3) Simple phrases with final consonants (imitation)\n- Briefly introduced two-word phrases including CVC words (e.g., \"hot dog,\" \"big cup\") in imitation.\n- He was able to imitate some of these phrases, but final consonant marking remained inconsistent, and the clinician provided substantial support.\n\n4) Intelligibility in conversation\n- In spontaneous language, his overall intelligibility to the clinician remained limited without context, though familiar routines and topics supported understanding.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on final consonants with consistent cueing, as skills appear to be consolidating rather than rapidly changing.\n- Maintain current /k/ work at sentence level to support carryover, without increasing task demands significantly at this time.\n- Home practice: encourage slow repetitions of a small set of CVC words and short phrases, with praise for any attempts to add the \"last sound.\"\n- Next session: similar targets; consider varying activities or materials to maintain motivation while working on the same goals."

Noted that child is \"chatty\" at home but often leaves off sounds at the ends of words. No major changes since initial evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with mild hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance.\n- Engaged well with toys and books, required occasional redirection from self-directed play back to structured tasks.\n- Participated in imitation tasks when given clear models and visual supports.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Initial /f/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- Practiced /f/ in isolation and simple CV syllables (\"fa, fee, foo\"). Child was able to approximate /f/ in isolation inconsistently with verbal cue \"bite your lip and blow\" and visual model.\n- At the imitated word level (e.g., \"fish, fan, foot, four\"), productions were often stopped to /p/ or omitted (\"pish\" for \"fish\").\n- Needed maximal verbal and visual cueing plus slowed rate. Accuracy was low but child was willing to attempt.\n\n2. Initial /s/ at word level (imitation)\n- Target words included \"sun, soap, sock, soup.\" Child frequently substituted /d/ or omitted the initial consonant (\"un\" for \"sun\").\n- With simultaneous production and direct visual cue to \"keep tongue behind teeth and use quiet air,\" child produced a few clearer /s/ sounds, though consistency was limited.\n- Child responded well to looking in mirror but required continuous cueing.\n\n3. Final consonant production (CVC words in imitation)\n- Focused on final /p, m, t/ in simple words (\"cup, map, cat, ham\").\n- Child often omitted final consonants in spontaneous play; in imitation, could mark the final sound some of the time with strong emphasis from SLP.\n- Productions were sometimes distorted or very quiet, suggesting emerging awareness but reduced consistency.\n\n4. Functional play-based speech sample\n- During play with farm animals and cars, child used mostly single words and short 2–3 word phrases (e.g., \"my car,\" \"go fast,\" \"more bubbles\").\n- Final consonant deletion and reduced intelligibility were noted across contexts, especially for less familiar words.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue targeting initial /f/ and /s/ at the imitated syllable and word levels with heavy visual/verbal cues.\n- Maintain focus on marking final consonants in CVC words during structured tasks.\n- Encourage caregiver to model slow, clear speech at home and highlight final sounds (\"cuP,\" \"maP\") in play without pressuring child to repeat every time."

Still difficult for extended family to understand child over the phone.\n- No concerns with hearing or general health this week.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered the room easily and appeared eager to show toys from home.\n- Good attention to tabletop tasks for short intervals; needed breaks with movement activities between drills.\n- Imitation attempts increased compared to last session, with less resistance to structured practice.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Initial /f/ at word level (imitation → supported spontaneous)\n- Reviewed /f/ in isolation; child produced a clearer /f/ sound more consistently with the \"bite-lip and blow\" cue and visual model.\n- Practiced words: \"fish, fan, feet, fork, four.\" Accuracy in imitation improved; several words were produced with recognizable /f/ when given a single verbal reminder.\n- In simple play routines (feeding animals \"fish\"), child began to produce \"fish\" independently after a few modeled trials, indicating early carryover.\n\n2. Initial /s/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- Used mirror and visual cue of \"snake sound\" to support production.\n- Child produced /s/ in isolation more reliably today and was able to sustain airflow for several seconds with support.\n- At word level (\"sun, sock, soap, soup\"), accuracy in imitation increased, though occasional substitutions (/d/ or omission) persisted. Fewer maximal cues were required; child responded to brief reminders like \"teeth together\" and \"quiet air.\"\n\n3. Final consonants in CVC words (imitation)\n- Targeted final /p, m, t/ using picture cards (\"cup, map, ham, cat, boat\").\n- Child showed better awareness of final sounds and sometimes attempted to self-correct after hearing the SLP emphasize the final consonant.\n- With slowed rate and a visual cue (pointing to mouth for the last sound), child could clearly mark final /p/ and /m/ in many imitated trials; final /t/ remained more inconsistent.\n\n4. Early /s/ blends at sound/cluster awareness level\n- Introduced concept of \"two sounds together\" for /s/ blends (e.g., /s/ + /t/ for \"st\").\n- Child was able to hear and identify when the SLP included vs. left out the /s/ in minimal pair contrasts (\"top\" vs. \"stop\") in a few trials, though production was not yet targeted.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Due to noticeable improvement, will continue building consistency with initial /f/ and /s/ at the word level and begin to incorporate more supported spontaneous productions in play.\n- Maintain work on final consonants with emphasis on final /t/.\n- Encourage caregiver to cue \"snake sound\" /s/ and \"bite-lip\" /f/ at home in short, playful routines (e.g., bath time, snack time), reinforcing successful attempts with specific praise."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\nMother reported that she understands about half of what her child says in daily routines, with more breakdowns when he is excited or talking to less familiar people. She noted that he often leaves off the ends of words and that preschool staff have commented on reduced clarity with peers.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nChild transitioned with some hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance. He was curious about materials and engaged well in play-based activities. Attention to task was fair; he needed occasional redirection from self-directed play back to speech tasks but responded well to visual supports and praise.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Baseline taken in play-based picture naming and imitation tasks. Child frequently omitted final consonants (e.g., \"bee\" for \"bed,\" \"boo\" for \"book\"). With direct imitation and visual cueing (pointing to the \"end sound\"), he produced final /p, t, m/ accurately in roughly one-third to half of opportunities. Productions were clearer in simultaneous imitation than in delayed imitation.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and syllables\n- Established baseline at sound and CV syllable level. Child often substituted /t/ for /k/ (e.g., \"tar\" for \"car\"). With tongue-back placement cues and a mirror, he was able to produce /k/ in isolation inconsistently, requiring maximal verbal and visual support. Very limited carryover into CV syllables; most attempts reverted to /t/.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation\n- Probed /s/ in isolation using a \"quiet snake\" visual. Child could approximate a prolonged /s/ with significant jaw and lip movement and occasional voice-on productions. Accuracy was low without cueing; with close modeling and reminders to \"keep tongue behind teeth,\" he could achieve a few accurate, sustained /s/ productions.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Observed syllable shapes during spontaneous play. CV and CVCV (reduplicated) forms were frequent (e.g., \"mama,\" \"baba\"), while CVC and more complex combinations were often reduced (e.g., \"ba\" for \"ball\"). Modeled clear CVCV productions and encouraged slowing down; child was able to imitate several CVCV words with improved clarity when given models.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue to target final consonants in CVC words and initial /k/ and /s/ at the isolation and simple syllable levels, focusing on establishing accurate placement. Provide parents with simple CVC picture cards (e.g., \"map,\" \"mat,\" \"cup\") and encourage short, playful practice (5 minutes) once per day, emphasizing the \"end sound.\" Next session, reassess initial /k/ and /s/ in syllables and consider introducing a small set of functional CVC words for home practice if accuracy improves."

She notices that when they go slowly, he can sometimes say the \"end sound,\" but in regular conversation he usually still leaves it off. Preschool teachers report no major changes in overall clarity yet.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nChild entered the room more easily and quickly engaged with preferred toys. He was generally cheerful and cooperative, with brief periods of silliness that required gentle redirection. He responded positively to visual cues and sticker reinforcement.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Practiced a small set of familiar CVC words (e.g., \"map,\" \"mat,\" \"cup,\" \"cap,\" \"ham\"). Compared to baseline, child showed a noticeable increase in attempts to mark the final sound. With modeling and a visual \"tap\" for the last sound, he produced clearer final consonants in many trials, although omissions still occurred when he spoke quickly. Accuracy in imitation appeared moderately improved, with more consistent final /p/ and /m/ than /t/.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on /k/ using mirror and tongue-back cues. Child produced /k/ in isolation more reliably today, often after one or two modeled attempts. Transition to CV syllables (e.g., \"koo,\" \"kah\") was somewhat more successful, though he continued to revert to /t/ without close support. He tolerated repeated practice and seemed proud when he heard the difference between /t/ and /k/ in minimal contrast pairs.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Targeted /s/ in isolation and in CV syllables (\"see,\" \"soo\"). Child required ongoing reminders for tongue placement and to keep lips relaxed. Compared to last week, he sustained /s/ for longer durations and with slightly less jaw movement. A few clearer /sV/ syllables emerged in imitation when paced slowly. Accuracy remained variable but showed early signs of improvement.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CVC, CVCV)\n- Used a simple board game to elicit CVC and CVCV words. Child continued to reduce many CVC words but showed increasing willingness to slow down and attempt all sounds when cued. Imitated several CVCV (alternating) words with clearer articulation than previously observed.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue current focus on final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/ at isolation and simple syllable levels. Encourage caregivers to emphasize slow, \"tapped\" end sounds in a few practice words each day, praising effort rather than perfection. Next session, consider trialing a few CVC words with /k/ final if isolation and CV remain stable."

She feels some words are getting easier to understand, especially when they are doing their \"speech games.\" Preschool staff mentioned a few clearer words during circle time.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nChild transitioned smoothly and appeared excited to show the clinician his \"speech words.\" He remained engaged for longer stretches today and required fewer prompts to stay with the activity. He responded well to turn-taking games and verbal praise.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Practiced CVC words in structured play (e.g., feeding animals \"cup,\" \"cap,\" \"map,\" \"mat,\" \"ham\"). Child demonstrated a marked improvement in consistency of final consonant marking in imitation. He often produced the final sound without needing a simultaneous model, and occasionally carried it over into short carrier phrases (\"my map,\" \"big cup\") when cued. Self-corrections were observed in several instances when he omitted the final consonant initially.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at syllable and word level\n- Given increased stability in isolation, moved more fully into CV and simple CVC words (\"car,\" \"key,\" \"cow\"). With verbal and visual placement cues, child produced initial /k/ correctly in many imitated trials. There were fewer /t/ substitutions than in previous sessions, and he was beginning to recognize when a production \"didn't sound right.\" Accuracy remained higher in direct imitation than in spontaneous attempts.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in CV and CVC words\n- Expanded from isolation to CV and a small set of CVC words (\"see,\" \"sun,\" \"soap,\" \"sock\"). Child was able to produce /s/ more consistently at the beginning of these words when provided with a visual cue and slowed rate. Distortions and occasional voiced productions persisted but were reduced compared to baseline. He responded well to minimal pair contrasts (e.g., \"sun\" vs. \"tun\") and could usually identify which word the clinician produced.\n\n4. Early phrases with target words\n- Introduced simple two-word phrases incorporating target CVC words (e.g., \"my cup,\" \"big map\"). Child could imitate these phrases with fair clarity when targets were produced correctly at the single-word level. Phrase-level work highlighted ongoing challenges with maintaining final consonants in connected speech, but also showed readiness to begin integrating targets into slightly longer utterances.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nGiven the meaningful gains with final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/ at the word level, continue to build consistency at this level and cautiously expand to short, structured phrases for practiced words. Provide caregiver with a small list of \"practice words\" and model how to turn them into two-word phrases at home (e.g., \"red cup,\" \"big sun\"), focusing on slow, clear productions."

She still notices many dropped sounds in longer words and fast speech but feels his \"practice words\" are easier to understand.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nChild entered the therapy room independently and quickly joined the clinician at the table. Attention was good overall with brief breaks built into activities. He was motivated by small games and chose his own stickers at the end.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m, k/)\n- Maintained work on /p, t, m/ and introduced some /k/ final words (e.g., \"back,\" \"book\"). At the imitated word level, child showed fairly consistent production of final /p/ and /m/, with fewer omissions than in previous sessions. Final /t/ and /k/ were less consistent but improving. He required fewer explicit \"end sound\" cues to include the consonant, particularly with familiar words.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word and emerging phrase level\n- Continued initial /k/ words (\"car,\" \"key,\" \"cow,\" \"coat\"). Accuracy at the imitated word level was noticeably stronger, with only occasional /t/ substitutions. Introduced simple two-word phrases (\"my car,\" \"go car,\" \"blue key\"). Child could imitate these phrases with reasonable clarity when given a model, though he sometimes reduced the phrase or dropped the target consonant in spontaneous attempts.\n\n3. Initial /s/ at word and early phrase level\n- Practiced initial /s/ words (\"sun,\" \"soap,\" \"sock,\" \"soup\") and moved into simple two-word combinations (\"big sun,\" \"my sock\"). Child produced initial /s/ more consistently with a brief visual cue and did not require as many repeated models as before. Some distortions remained, but productions were generally recognizable and more stable. He occasionally attempted /s/ words independently during play.\n\n4. Generalization in structured play\n- Incorporated target words into a pretend picnic game to encourage more natural use. Child was able to use several target CVC words and a few two-word phrases when prompted within the game. Carryover of accurate final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/ was better in this structured play context than in unstructured conversation but still required cues.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue to strengthen consistency of final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/ at the word and short-phrase levels. Encourage caregiver to use simple two-word phrases with familiar targets at home (e.g., \"my cup,\" \"big car\"), focusing on slow rate and clear end sounds. Next session, consider introducing a small number of new /k/ and /s/ words if accuracy remains stable."

She still has to remind him sometimes to \"finish the word,\" but she feels he is trying harder.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nChild was bright and eager to participate. He attended well to clinician models and accepted feedback without frustration. A short movement break midway through the session helped maintain focus.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m, k/)\n- Continued practice with a mix of familiar and a few new CVC words. Child's accuracy for final /p/ and /m/ in imitation was high and remained fairly stable across the session. Final /t/ and /k/ showed small but reliable gains, with fewer omissions and more attempts to self-correct. He needed similar levels of cueing as last week but responded to reminders more quickly.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word and phrase level\n- Practiced known /k/ words and added a couple of new items (e.g., \"cat,\" \"cake\"). At the imitated word level, productions were generally accurate with occasional /t/ substitutions. In short phrases (\"my cake,\" \"go car\"), he maintained /k/ in many attempts but still reduced or substituted in less structured play. Overall performance showed gradual improvement rather than a large shift.\n\n3. Initial /s/ at word and short phrase level\n- Targeted initial /s/ in familiar words and phrases (\"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"see,\" \"my sock,\" \"big sun\"). Child continued to require visual and verbal placement cues but produced more consistent, recognizable /s/ sounds compared to earlier sessions. Distortions were present but less frequent. His level of support needed was similar to last week, with a slight increase in independent attempts.\n\n4. Integration in play-based routines\n- Used a simple race game and a pretend house scenario to embed target words. Child used several target words spontaneously during play, although accuracy dropped somewhat without direct cueing. He was receptive to gentle reminders and often corrected himself when cued.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nMaintain focus on consolidating gains at the word and two-word phrase levels for final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/. Caregiver encouraged to continue brief daily practice, highlighting slow, clear speech for a few chosen words and phrases. Next session, plan to monitor for readiness to expand to slightly longer phrases for well-established targets."

She feels overall speech is still mixed, with clearer moments and some times when he \"rushes\" and is harder to understand.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nChild separated easily from caregiver and participated well throughout. He showed good persistence with practice trials, especially when activities were game-based. Mild fatigue was noted near the end of the session, but he remained cooperative.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m, k/)\n- Revisited a set of familiar CVC words. Performance was similar to last week, with consistently strong final /p/ and /m/ and somewhat less consistent /t/ and /k/. He continued to require verbal reminders to \"keep the last sound\" in less structured play, though he showed awareness and occasional self-corrections. No major change in cueing level was observed.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word and short phrase level\n- Practiced known /k/ words and two-word phrases (\"my car,\" \"blue key,\" \"go cow\"). Accuracy at the imitated word level remained stable, with mostly correct /k/ when prompted. In short phrases, he could maintain /k/ in many imitated attempts but was less consistent in spontaneous play. Overall, skills appeared to be consolidating rather than shifting to a new level.\n\n3. Initial /s/ at word and short phrase level\n- Continued focus on initial /s/ words (\"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"soap\") and two-word combinations. Child still needed visual placement cues and reminders to keep the sound \"quiet\" and unvoiced. Accuracy and clarity were similar to last session, with some emerging independent productions but no clear jump in performance.\n\n4. Functional use in routines\n- Incorporated target words into a snack-time role-play to support functional carryover. Child used a few target words (\"cup,\" \"sock,\" \"car\") during the routine, with variable accuracy. He responded positively to praise when his speech was easier to understand.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue current targets, allowing time for consolidation of skills at the word and two-word phrase levels. Encourage caregiver to maintain short, positive practice sessions at home, focusing on a small set of high-use words. Next session, monitor for any new increases in independence or accuracy that would support moving to longer phrases for the most consistent targets."

He initiated several interactions with the clinician and was eager to share toys. Some impulsive talking made it challenging to slow down for practice at times, but with structured games he was able to focus well.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words and short phrases)\n- Reviewed familiar CVC words and embedded them in short, structured phrases (\"my cup,\" \"big map,\" \"red cap\"). Child maintained good accuracy for final /p/ and /m/ in both single words and imitated phrases. Final /t/ and /k/ continued to be more variable but showed slightly increased consistency compared to earlier in the block. Cueing needs were similar to recent sessions, suggesting ongoing consolidation rather than a major shift.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in words and carrier phrases\n- Practiced initial /k/ words (\"car,\" \"cake,\" \"key\") and simple carrier phrases (\"I see car,\" \"I want cake\"). Child produced /k/ accurately in many imitated trials, with occasional /t/ substitutions. At the phrase level, he needed modeling and pacing support to maintain clarity. Overall accuracy was in line with previous sessions, with no substantial change in support level.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases\n- Continued initial /s/ targets (\"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"soap\") and short phrases (\"my sock,\" \"big sun\"). Child demonstrated similar performance to last week, with recognizable /s/ productions when cued and more distortions when speaking quickly. He showed interest in listening for \"snake sounds\" in the clinician's speech but still required consistent external cues.\n\n4. Spontaneous use of target words in play\n- During free play, child spontaneously used some target words and short phrases (e.g., \"my car,\" \"big sock\") with mixed accuracy. He was receptive to light feedback and enjoyed repeating \"better\" versions of his words.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nMaintain the current level of practice for final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/ within single words and short phrases, aiming for greater consistency and self-monitoring. Caregiver encouraged to highlight clear three-word phrases at home (e.g., \"my big car\"), providing gentle models rather than frequent corrections.

She feels his speech is easier to follow during routines like mealtimes.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nChild transitioned smoothly and was very engaged in structured tasks. He showed good stamina for practice and was interested in \"beating his score\" in simple counting games. He accepted feedback well and demonstrated pride in clearer productions.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words in short sentences)\n- Given stable performance at the phrase level, expanded some familiar CVC words into short, structured sentences (e.g., \"I see the cup,\" \"I have a map\"). Child maintained high accuracy for final /p/ and /m/ and showed improved consistency for final /t/ and /k/ in imitated sentences compared to prior sessions. He required fewer explicit \"end sound\" cues and sometimes corrected himself when he noticed an omission.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in carrier phrases and short sentences\n- Targeted initial /k/ in simple carrier phrases and short sentences (\"I want cake,\" \"I see car,\" \"the cow is big\"). Child produced /k/ accurately in most imitated phrases and was beginning to use it more independently in structured play. There were fewer /t/ substitutions and more automatic correct productions, indicating a meaningful increase in independence.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in short phrases and emerging sentences\n- Practiced initial /s/ in short phrases and simple sentence frames (\"see the sun,\" \"I see socks\"). Child continued to require reminders for tongue placement but was able to maintain a clearer /s/ in multiple-word contexts more often than in earlier sessions. Distortions decreased somewhat, and he tolerated more repetitions without losing accuracy.\n\n4. Functional generalization in play-based activities\n- Used a storybook and pretend play to elicit target words and short sentences. Child produced several clear, multiword utterances with target sounds when given a model (e.g., \"I see car,\" \"big soap here\"). His overall intelligibility within these structured activities was noticeably better than at the start of the block.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue to practice final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/ within short sentences and structured carrier phrases, while still monitoring accuracy at the single-word level. Provide caregiver with simple sentence frames to practice at home (e.g., \"I see ___,\" \"I want ___\") using known target words.

He showed good participation in structured tasks and enjoyed choosing which picture cards to practice. Occasional distractibility was managed with brief movement breaks.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words in short sentences)\n- Continued work with CVC targets in short, structured sentences. Child maintained strong accuracy for final /p/ and /m/ and reasonably good accuracy for final /t/ and /k/ in imitated sentences. Performance was comparable to last session, suggesting stable skills at this level. He still benefited from occasional reminders to slow down in connected speech.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in carrier phrases and short sentences\n- Practiced initial /k/ in a variety of carrier phrases (\"I see car,\" \"I like cake,\" \"I have a key\"). Child generally produced /k/ correctly when imitating sentences and often did so independently within structured play. A few /t/ substitutions occurred when he spoke quickly, but overall accuracy and cueing needs were similar to last week.\n\n3.

He participated well in both table-top and floor activities. Some playful silliness emerged toward the end of the session, but he remained redirectable.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words in structured sentences)\n- Continued practice with known CVC words embedded in short sentences. Child's production of final consonants remained stable, with high accuracy for /p/ and /m/ and good, though somewhat variable, accuracy for /t/ and /k/. He continued to need occasional pacing cues in connected speech but showed no regression.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in short sentences and structured conversation\n- Practiced initial /k/ in sentence frames and brief, structured conversational turns (e.g., asking for \"car\" or \"cake\" during a turn-taking game). Child maintained correct /k/ in most imitated and many spontaneous sentences in these structured contexts. Performance was consistent with prior sessions, with no notable change in level of support required.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in short sentences\n- Targeted initial /s/ in short sentences (\"see the sun,\" \"I see socks,\" \"Sam sits down\"). Child produced /s/ with similar clarity and consistency as last week when supported by visual cues and slowed rate. He still tended to distort /s/ in faster, less structured speech.\n\n4. Generalization to brief narrative\n- Used a short picture sequence to elicit simple story-like sentences (e.g., \"The car goes up,\" \"The boy sees soap\"). Child could produce several sentences with target sounds when modeled first. His overall intelligibility in this structured narrative context was similar to other sentence-level tasks.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue at the current sentence-level focus, emphasizing slow rate and self-monitoring. Encourage caregiver to prompt him to \"use his clear speech\" during brief storytelling or recounting daily events. Next session, plan to provide more opportunities for semi-spontaneous sentence production with faded models for familiar target words."

He showed strong interest in sharing information and engaging in pretend play. At times his eagerness to talk made it challenging to maintain slow, careful productions, but he responded to visual reminders.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1.

He demonstrated good attention for his age and was proud to show how he could \"use his sounds.\" He accepted feedback and was willing to revise his productions when prompted.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words in conversation and narratives)\n- Probed final consonant use in more natural conversation and simple story retells. Child generally marked final /p/ and /m/ consistently and produced final /t/ and /k/ in many contexts, though omissions still occurred when he spoke quickly or excitedly. Compared to earlier in the block, his ability to carry final consonants into connected speech has improved substantially, and these skills now appear relatively stable at this higher level.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in conversation\n- Observed and elicited initial /k/ words during open-ended play and discussion (e.g., talking about cars, coats, and cake). Child produced /k/ correctly in most opportunities, including many spontaneous sentences, with only occasional /t/ substitutions. He showed emerging self-correction when errors occurred, indicating good internalization of the sound pattern.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in conversation\n- Monitored initial /s/ productions during semi-structured conversation and targeted practice. Child produced clearer, more consistent /s/ sounds in many sentence-initial positions when he was cued to slow down and \"make a quiet snake sound.\" Distortions and occasional substitutions persisted in fast or less monitored speech, but overall accuracy has improved notably since the start of the block.\n\n4. Overall intelligibility and functional communication\n- In structured conversation with the clinician, his speech was generally intelligible, with breakdowns mainly during rapid speech or with unfamiliar words. He used multiword sentences to share information and participate in play, and he was able to repair some communication breakdowns when asked to \"say it again with your good sounds.\"\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nRecommend ongoing speech-language services to further support generalization of final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/ into spontaneous conversation across settings and with unfamiliar listeners. Home program: caregiver to continue brief daily practice focusing on slow, clear sentences using target sounds, and to gently prompt self-correction when possible. Future sessions will monitor maintenance of gains and introduce any new sound targets as appropriate."

Initial /s/ at the imitated syllable and word level\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation using a \"snake sound\" visual; able to approximate /s/ with heavy cueing (jaw support, visual model, verbal cue to keep tongue behind teeth).\n- At CV syllable level (\"see, so, sue\"), accuracy was inconsistent; often substituted /t/ or omitted the sound (e.g., \"ee\" for \"see\").\n- At the imitated word level (sun, sock, soup, soap), productions were mostly approximations; required maximal verbal and visual cueing.\n\n2. Initial /sh/ in isolation and simple words\n- Targeted /sh/ in isolation using hand cue near lips and auditory bombardment.\n- Child could produce a close approximation with direct imitation when reminded to round lips.\n- At the word level (shoe, ship), accuracy was low; often produced /s/ or /ch/ instead.\n\n3. Final consonant production (p, m) in CVC words\n- Used picture cards (map, mop, mom) and play-based tasks.\n- Child frequently omitted final consonants in spontaneous attempts (e.g., \"ma\" for \"map\").\n- With direct imitation and verbal cue to \"keep the sound at the end,\" showed some accurate productions but not yet consistent.\n\n4. Functional phrase use (2–3 word phrases in play)\n- Encouraged simple carrier phrases such as \"my ___,\" \"more ___\" during play.\n- Child used mostly single words spontaneously but imitated short phrases with a model.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to target initial /s/ and /sh/ at the isolation and simple word level with maximal support.\n- Maintain focus on final consonants /p, m/ in CVC words in structured play.\n- Provide parent with simple practice ideas: exaggerate final sounds in short words during daily routines (e.g., \"up, mop, map\").\n- Next session: reassess response to cueing for /s/ and consider introducing a small set of highly familiar /s/ words for repetitive practice."

Parent shared that familiar family members usually understand the child, but new listeners often ask for repetition.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated from parent with brief reassurance and transitioned into the therapy room with a preferred toy. Initially quiet but warmed up after a few minutes of play. Attended to adult-directed tasks for short intervals (2–3 minutes) with occasional redirection back to the activity.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /s/ at word level (imitation)\n- Target words included \"sun, soap, sock, soup, sit, sad.\" Child attempted to imitate most models. Productions were inconsistent; substitutions included /d/ and /z/ for /s/ (e.g., \"dun\" for \"sun,\" \"zoup\" for \"soup\").\n- Able to imitate a clear /s/ in isolation several times with verbal cueing to \"keep the tongue behind the teeth\" and a visual cue to smile. Accuracy at word level appeared low but with several approximations.\n\n2. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, m, t/)\n- Practiced words such as \"up, cup, mop, map, hat, hot, home.\" Child frequently omitted final consonants (e.g., \"cu\" for \"cup\"). With direct imitation and modeling, the child occasionally added the final sound.\n- Tapping or pointing to a picture for the \"end sound\" helped the child mark some final consonants, but consistency was limited.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in syllables and words (imitation)\n- Practiced /f/ in CV syllables (\"fa, fee, foo\") and simple words (\"fish, fun, four\"). Child tended to replace /f/ with /p/ (e.g., \"pish\" for \"fish\").\n- With a model of blowing air on the hand and verbal cues for \"bite your lip and blow,\" child produced a few clearer /f/ sounds in isolation and in syllables, but carryover to words was limited.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CV and CVCV)\n- Observed during play-based naming (e.g., \"bunny, baby, teddy, kitty\"). Child produced many CV and reduplicated CVCV forms (\"baba\" for \"banana\"). Syllables were usually present, but some consonants were not clearly articulated.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to target initial /s/ and /f/ at the imitated word level with strong visual and verbal cues.\n- Continue supporting final consonant production in CVC words using tapping/visual supports.\n- Parent encouraged to model slow, clear productions of target words (sun, soup, fish, up, cup) during daily routines without pressuring the child to repeat."

No specific changes in clarity reported, though parent feels the child is \"easier to understand\" when they are calm and not rushing.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered the therapy room willingly and quickly engaged in play-based tasks. Attention to activities improved compared to last week, with the child able to stay with a structured game for several minutes. Mild silliness at times but easily redirected.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /s/ at word and emerging phrase level (imitation)\n- Revisited target words \"sun, soap, sock, soup, sit, sand\" within a picture game. Child produced more consistent /s/ in isolation with a visual cue (smile + tongue behind teeth) and light verbal reminders.\n- At the imitated word level, accuracy was noticeably higher than last session, with several clear productions of \"sun\" and \"sock\" in a row. Began to trial short carrier phrases (\"my sun,\" \"sock on\") with mixed accuracy; /s/ sometimes dropped or changed to /d/.\n\n2. Final consonant production in CVC words (/p, m, t/)\n- Practiced \"cup, up, map, mop, hat, hot\" using a turn-taking board game. Child marked final consonants more frequently than last week when given a model plus a visual cue (touching the mouth for the end sound).\n- Still omitted some final sounds in spontaneous attempts, but was able to correct a few productions when cued (e.g., changed \"cu\" to \"cup\" after a prompt).\n\n3. Initial /f/ in syllables and words (imitation)\n- Used a mirror and blowing activities to support /f/ production (\"fish, four, fun, feet\"). Child showed clearer /f/ productions in isolation and CV syllables with the \"bite lip and blow\" cue.\n- At word level, still some /p/ substitutions, but several accurate productions of \"fish\" and \"feet\" were noted, especially when the child watched the clinician's mouth.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CVCV, multisyllabic approximations)\n- During play, child produced CVCV words like \"baby, teddy, bunny\" and approximated longer words (\"nana\" for \"banana\"). Compared with last week, syllable marking was similar, but more consonants were audible in some attempts.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue building consistency for initial /s/ in words and trial short phrases when accuracy is good in single words.\n- Maintain focus on final consonants in high-interest CVC words, reinforcing \"end sounds\" with tapping or pointing.\n- Ongoing practice of /f/ with mirror and airflow cues; encourage parent to play \"blowing\" games at home and then add target words such as \"feet\" and \"fish\" in books or bath time."

Child attempted these words with most syllables present but with simplified consonants (e.g., \"nana\" for \"banana\").\n- Parent was shown how to gently slow and clap/tap out syllables for fun during shared book reading.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Given the improvement, continue to expand initial /s/ to more words and short phrases, especially in simple play routines.\n- Maintain work on final consonants, focusing on /p/ and /m/ which are showing better responsiveness, and continue cueing for /t/.\n- For /f/, begin to fade visual cues when possible and monitor for more spontaneous use in play.\n- Home: parent to practice a small set of words (\"sun, sock, fish, feet, cup\") during daily routines, praising clear attempts rather than perfection."

Demonstrated good turn-taking and followed simple directions. Needed occasional reminders to use a \"quiet body\" but overall regulation and participation were strong.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /s/ at phrase level and emerging sentence level\n- Reviewed familiar /s/ words (\"sun, sock, soup, seal, soap\") and then embedded them into short carrier phrases (\"I see __,\" \"my __,\" \"put __ in\"). Child produced /s/ accurately in many imitated phrases with light verbal cueing.\n- Began to trial short sentences during play (e.g., \"I see sun,\" \"I see soap\"). Child was able to keep the /s/ sound in the first word most of the time when reminded to \"start with the snake sound.\" Some phrases were produced spontaneously, such as \"my sock\" while dressing a toy.\n\n2. Final consonants in CVC words (/p, m, t/; imitation and structured play)\n- Practiced within a board game using picture cards (\"cup, map, mop, hat, hot, home, cat\"). Child showed increased consistency in marking final /p/ and /m\" in imitation and occasionally in spontaneous attempts.\n- Final /t/ remained more challenging; child often produced a vowel ending or a soft /d/. With a cue to \"tap the end sound,\" there were several clear final /t/ productions in words like \"hat\" and \"cat.\"\n\n3. Initial /f/ at word and phrase level\n- Target words: \"fish, feet, fun, four, food\" and phrases \"my fish,\" \"four fish,\" \"feet up.\" Child produced /f/ in isolation independently and required fewer reminders to maintain lip placement.\n- At the phrase level, the child was able to keep the /f/ sound in many imitated phrases. Some spontaneous uses were observed (e.g., \"my fish\" during play) with fair clarity.\n\n4. Early /s/ blend awareness (listening and minimal attempts)\n- Introduced simple /s/ blends in a listening game (\"spoon, star, stop\") to help the child notice the cluster. Child was able to point to the correct picture when the clinician contrasted words like \"top/stop\" and \"tar/star.\"\n- Imitation of /s/ blends was limited; child often reduced the cluster (e.g., \"top\" for \"stop\"). Focus remained on auditory discrimination rather than production at this time.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen initial /s/ and /f/ in phrases and short sentences, with a focus on light cueing and emerging independence.\n- Maintain practice of final consonants, especially /t/, using visual/tactile cues.\n- Gradually introduce more structured practice for simple /s/ blends as the child is ready, starting with listening and then supported imitation.\n- Home: encourage parent to use simple carrier phrases (\"I see __,\" \"my __\") with target words and to reinforce when the child uses clear end sounds."

Accuracy and independence were slightly better than last week but still required occasional verbal reminders.\n\n4. Early /s/ blends (continued listening + limited production)\n- Repeated the minimal pair listening task (e.g., \"top/stop,\" \"tar/star\") and the child reliably identified the correct word when listening.\n- Imitated /s/ blends such as \"spoon, star, stop\" remained challenging; child typically reduced the cluster (\"poon,\" \"tar,\" \"top\").

Initial /k/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation using a \"back sound\" cue and mirror. Child was able to imitate /k/ in isolation inconsistently, with frequent substitutions of /t/.\n- At CV syllable level (\"koo, kay, kee\"), accuracy was low; most attempts shifted to /t/ or omitted the consonant. Required maximal verbal and visual cues and simultaneous productions with clinician.\n- Introduced a few high-interest words (\"car, cow, cookie\") in imitation. Child could approximate \"car\" with a fronted /t/ sound (\"tar\"), despite repeated models.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)\n- Introduced /f/ as a \"lip bite\" sound using a mirror and tactile prompts to the lower lip.\n- In isolation, child could produce a recognizable /f/ in some attempts with heavy cueing; many productions were stopped to /p/ or omitted.\n- At CV syllables (\"fee, foo\"), child often reverted to /p/ or a neutral vowel. Accuracy remained low but child tolerated practice and attempted to copy clinician.\n\n3. CVC syllable shape (final consonants /p, m/ in play)\n- During play with toys and picture cards, targeted simple CVC words (\"map, mop, pop, mom\").\n- Child tended to omit final consonants (\"ma\" for \"map\"), even with models. With direct imitation and gesture cues for \"closing the word,\" occasional final /p/ and /m/ were heard but not yet consistent.\n\n4. Functional communication / spontaneous phrases\n- Child used several spontaneous 2–3 word phrases in play (e.g., \"my turn,\" \"more car,\" \"where go?\").\n- Intelligibility decreased in longer phrases, with consonant omissions and sound substitutions throughout.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build awareness of /k/ and /f/ in isolation and simple syllables next session; maintain focus at imitation level.\n- Encourage parent to model clear /k/ and /f/ words during daily routines (e.g., \"car,\" \"cookie,\" \"fish,\" \"food\") without pressuring for imitation.\n- Plan to gather additional baseline data on final consonants and overall syllable shapes in upcoming sessions."

Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)\n- Reviewed /k/ in isolation with mirror and \"back of the mouth\" cue. Child produced clearer /k/ more frequently than last session with moderate verbal cues.\n- At CV level (\"koo, kay, key\"), child was able to produce approximations with /k/ emerging in about half of attempts when given slowed rate and visual cueing.\n- Still fronted /k/ to /t/ at times, but showed more willingness to self-correct after clinician modeled the difference.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word level (imitation)\n- Trialed a small set of /k/ words (\"car, cow, key, cookie\") in imitation.\n- Child produced approximations of \"car\" and \"cow\" with a more noticeable /k/ onset in several trials when provided with a simultaneous production and gesture to the throat.\n- Accuracy remained inconsistent, but performance was stronger than in baseline session, indicating emerging control.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)\n- Practiced \"lip bite\" /f/ in front of the mirror.

CVC words with final /p, m/ (imitation)\n- Targeted a small set of high-interest CVC words (\"pop, map, mop, mom\") in direct imitation.\n- Child continued to drop final consonants often but demonstrated a few clearer final /p/ productions when given a \"closing the word\" hand cue.\n- Final /m/ was more difficult; often reduced to an open syllable.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on /k/ and /f/ at isolation and simple syllable levels, with brief trials at word level as tolerated.\n- Provide parent with simple visual of \"lip bite\" /f/ to use during book reading and snack time (e.g., \"fish,\" \"food,\" \"fun\").\n- Continue monitoring final consonants; not yet ready to systematically increase complexity."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\nMom reported that she understands most of what he says, but others have a harder time. She notices he often leaves off the ends of words and says “tup” for “cup” and “tar” for “car.” No major changes since the evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned with some hesitation but separated from mom with reassurance. He was generally cooperative and curious, though he preferred to move quickly between toys. Needed intermittent redirection to stay with structured tasks but responded well to visual supports and turn-taking games.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, m, t/)\n- Targeted final consonants in simple CVC words (e.g., “cup, map, cat, sit, mop”) at the imitation level.\n- Client frequently omitted final consonants or substituted a neutral vowel (“cu-” for “cup”).\n- With maximal verbal cues (e.g., “stop your sound,” “close your lips at the end”) and tactile cues on his chin/hand-over-hand tapping, he was able to mark some final sounds, but accuracy was inconsistent and required slow pacing and repetition.\n\n2. Initial /k/ vs /t/ contrast (fronting)\n- Practiced initial /k/ in isolation and in simple syllables (e.g., “ku, ki, ka”) using visual cues (tongue “back sound”) and mirror.\n- Client often produced /t/ for /k/ in imitation, even with modeling.\n- A few accurate /k/ productions emerged when paired with a strong cough-like cue and exaggerated model, but he was not yet consistent.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Introduced “snake sound” /s/ in isolation with visual cue (finger for airflow) and mirror.\n- Client was able to approximate a prolonged airflow in isolation with moderate verbal and gestural support, though he frequently added a vowel (“suh”).\n- Attempted /s/ in CV syllables (e.g., “see, so, suh”), but productions often shifted to /d/ or /sh/; remained largely at isolation level today.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Observed spontaneous productions during play: mostly CV and CVCV reduplicated forms (e.g., “baba,” “mama,” “nana”), with fewer clear CVC words.\n- Used simple picture routines to model CVCV (alternating) words (e.g., “puppy, baby”) and encouraged imitation; client could imitate the overall syllable pattern but individual sounds were often unclear.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue targeting final consonants in simple CVC words at the imitation level, using tapping and “stop your sound” cues.\n- Continue establishing /k/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables before moving up to consistent word-level practice.\n- Encourage parents to model slow, clear CVC words in daily routines (e.g., “cup, bed, hat”) without pressuring him to repeat; praise any attempts to mark the ending sound."

She feels his speech is about the same overall.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient separated easily today and went straight for the car toys. He was engaged when activities were play-based and brief, but he became silly when tasks were too repetitive. Responded well to visual schedules and choices between two activities.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words (/p, m, t/)\n- Continued practice at the imitation level with picture cards and play (e.g., feeding animals “cup, ham, hat, map”).\n- Client required frequent verbal reminders (“close your lips,” “put your tongue up at the end”) and hand-tapping cues.\n- Some emerging attempts to mark the final sound were observed (e.g., “cu(p), ma(p)”), but endings were still often weak or omitted.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in syllables and words\n- Revisited /k/ in isolation and CV syllables with mirror and “back sound” explanation.\n- Client continued to substitute /t/ for /k/ in many attempts, though a few more clear /k/ productions were noted compared to last session, especially when paired with a “cough” cue.\n- Trialed a small number of CVC words (e.g., “car, cup”) in imitation; accuracy remained low and required maximal support.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation using “snake sound” visual and airflow cues. Client produced a sustained /s/ more consistently today with moderate cueing.\n- In CV syllables (e.g., “see, so, sa”), productions were mixed: some clear /s/ on initial trials, but often followed by a schwa or changed to /d/.\n- Still primarily at syllable level; not yet ready for structured word-level practice.\n\n4. Syllable structure (CVCV words)\n- Used a farm play routine to elicit CVCV words (e.g., “piggy, puppy, baby”).\n- Client imitated overall rhythm of multisyllabic words but tended to reduce or blur consonants.\n- No notable changes in spontaneous syllable patterns compared to last session.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue current targets; skills appear relatively stable and still in early acquisition.\n- Maintain focus on consistent final consonant marking and establishing clearer /k/ and /s/ in simple syllables.\n- Home: Encourage slow models of CVC words and praise any attempts to add an ending sound; continue modeling “snake sound” with long /s/ during play (e.g., toy snakes, cars going “ssss”)."

He sustained attention well for short table tasks when paired with motivating toys. Occasional restlessness, but he accepted breaks and returned to work with gentle prompts.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words (/p, m, t/)\n- Practiced CVC words at the imitation level using picture cards and a “feed the monster” game (e.g., “cup, map, mat, ham, sit”).\n- Notable improvement in his ability to mark final consonants when given a model and a simple cue (e.g., tapping the table at the end). Many productions were approximated but recognizable (e.g., “cu[p], ma[p]”).\n- Accuracy and consistency increased compared to previous sessions, though he still needed prompts to slow down and avoid dropping endings.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in syllables and CVC words\n- Continued with /k/ in isolation and CV syllables, then moved into a small set of CVC words (e.g., “car, key, cow, cup”).\n- With focused cueing (mirror, “tongue back,” “cough” trick), he produced several accurate /k/ sounds in initial position.\n- He remained inconsistent and occasionally reverted to /t/, but he showed more successful attempts and some self-correction when cued.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in CV syllables and emerging word level\n- Practiced /s/ in CV syllables (e.g., “see, so, su, sa”) with visual and verbal cues.\n- Accuracy in syllables improved; he could produce a clearer /s/ at the beginning with moderate support.\n- Trialed a few simple words (e.g., “sun, sock”) at the imitation level. Productions were variable but a few recognizable /s/ initial words were achieved with cues.\n\n4. Syllable shapes and simple phrases\n- Observed more CVC attempts in spontaneous play (e.g., “bus,” “hot,” approximations for “cat”).\n- Modeled 2–3 word carrier phrases (e.g., “my ___,” “big ___”) during toy play. Client imitated some short phrases, but sound accuracy within phrases dropped compared to single words.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build consistency for final consonants at the word level and strengthen emerging /k/ and /s/ productions.\n- Begin to increase the set of CVC words where endings are marked more reliably.\n- Home: Practice a small list of familiar CVC words (e.g., “cup, map, hat, hot”) using slow speech and gentle reminders to “finish the word”; keep practice short and playful."

He tolerated brief table-top tasks and transitioned between play and work with simple visual cues. Minimal avoidance behaviours today.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words (/p, m, t, k/)\n- Expanded CVC targets to include /k/ final (e.g., “back, book”) in addition to /p, m, t/.\n- At the imitation level, he showed increasing consistency marking final /p, m, t/ with moderate cues; fewer complete omissions compared to earlier sessions.\n- Final /k/ remained more challenging, with some productions approximated as /t/ or omitted, but he attempted the back sound when reminded.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word level\n- Focused on a small set of initial /k/ words (e.g., “car, cow, key, cup”) in imitation.\n- Demonstrated more frequent accurate /k/ productions at the start of words, especially in structured drills with mirror.\n- Still required verbal prompts to keep the tongue back, but needed slightly fewer repetitions to achieve a correct production.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words and simple phrases\n- Practiced initial /s/ words (e.g., “sun, sock, soup, seat”) at the imitation level.\n- Accuracy was variable but improved compared to the prior week; he produced several clear /s/ initial words with moderate cues.\n- Briefly introduced 2-word phrases with initial /s/ words (e.g., “sun up,” “sock on”). Within phrases, /s/ sometimes became less distinct, but he attempted the sound and could correct with support.\n\n4. Short carrier phrases with target words\n- Used simple carriers (e.g., “my ___,” “go ___”) to embed CVC targets in phrases.\n- Client imitated some 2–3 word phrases with clearer final consonants, though endings were still more consistent in single words than in phrases.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating final consonant production, especially /k/ final, and strengthening initial /k/ and /s/ at the word level.\n- Gradually increase practice of short phrases once word-level accuracy is more stable.\n- Home: Encourage practice with picture cards or real objects for a small group of /k/ and /s/ words, using slow models and positive feedback for any clear attempts."

He participated well in structured tasks and enjoyed turn-taking games. Needed occasional prompts to slow down his speech when excited but remained cooperative throughout.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words (/p, m, t, k/)\n- Practiced a larger set of CVC words in imitation and during play.\n- Final /p, m, t/ were generally well-marked in imitation with only light cues; he occasionally omitted endings in spontaneous speech but could add them when reminded.\n- Final /k/ showed gradual improvement; he produced clearer endings in words like “back” and “book” when paced slowly, though consistency was still emerging.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word and phrase level\n- Continued with initial /k/ words and short phrases (e.g., “my car,” “go car,” “key please”).\n- Word-level /k/ was fairly consistent with moderate cues; he needed reminders to use his “back sound” but required fewer repetitions to get a correct production.\n- In phrases, /k/ was present in many attempts but sometimes softened or changed to /t/ when he rushed.\n\n3. Initial /s/ at word level and limited phrases\n- Practiced initial /s/ words (e.g., “sun, sock, sit, soup”) with visual and verbal cues.\n- Accuracy showed slight improvement; he could maintain a clearer /s/ at the beginning of several words, though not yet reliably across the full set.\n- Trialed a few short phrases with /s/ words (e.g., “sun up,” “sock on”); within phrases, he often needed a reminder to use his snake sound.\n\n4.

Family notices that familiar listeners usually understand him, but new people have more difficulty.\n- No new medical or developmental concerns reported.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- 4-year-old client transitioned into the therapy room with brief hesitation but separated from parent without tears.\n- Engaged well with toys and turn-taking games. Attention was best in play-based, highly structured tasks; needed occasional redirection away from preferred toys when it was time to practice.\n\nGoals / session focus:\nGoal 1: Initial /s/ at word level (imitation)\n- Targeted initial /s/ in single words (e.g., sun, sock, soup, sand) using direct imitation with visual cueing (watching clinician's mouth) and a \"snake sound\" cue.\n- Accuracy in imitation was generally low to emerging; productions were often substituted with /d/ or omitted altogether (e.g., \"un\" for \"sun\").\n- Client could sometimes approximate a prolonged /s/ in isolation with maximal modeling, but this did not consistently carry over into words.\n\nGoal 2: Initial /f/ at syllable and simple word level (imitation)\n- Practiced /f/ in CV syllables (\"fa, fee, foo\") and simple words (e.g., four, fish, fun) using tactile cues to bite the lip and blow air.\n- Client produced /f/ in isolation with moderate support; in syllables, accuracy was inconsistent and frequently stopped to /p/.\n- Required frequent verbal reminders and slowed pacing to coordinate airflow and lip placement.\n\nGoal 3: Final consonant production in CVC words (p, m, t)\n- Probed final consonant use in high-interest CVC words (e.g., map, mop, mat, mom) in imitation.\n- Client frequently omitted final consonants, particularly in spontaneous play. With simultaneous production and visual cues (pointing to a final sound icon), could mark some final /p/ and /m/ but not yet consistent.\n\nGoal 4: CV and CVCV syllable shapes\n- Observed and elicited a variety of syllable shapes during play (e.g., \"baby, bunny, teddy\").\n- CV and reduplicated CVCV forms (e.g., \"mama, dada\") were produced readily; alternating CVCV (e.g., \"bunny\") were sometimes simplified.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue targeting initial /s/ and /f/ at the imitated word level with heavy visual and tactile cueing.\n- Maintain focus on marking final consonants in simple CVC words using simultaneous productions and visual prompts.\n- Encourage parent to model clear, slightly slowed speech at home and emphasize final sounds in familiar words (e.g., \"up,\" \"cup\") without pressuring the child to repeat.\n- Next session: re-check initial /s/ and /f/ in isolation and syllables, and continue structured play tasks to support emerging consonant production."

Attention to adult-directed tasks was improved compared to last week with fewer redirections.\n\nGoals / session focus:\nGoal 1: Initial /s/ at word level (imitation → early cued independence)\n- Practiced initial /s/ in single words (sun, soap, sock, soup, sand) using visual, verbal, and minimal tactile cues.\n- Compared with last session, accuracy in imitation improved; client produced a more consistent hiss-like /s/ at the beginning of words when given a short model.\n- Began to fade to delayed imitation (clinician says the word, then client repeats after a short pause) with moderate success. Occasional independent /s/ attempts were heard in structured tasks, though not yet reliable.\n\nGoal 2: Initial /f/ in CV syllables and words (imitation)\n- Targeted /f/ in CV syllables (\"fee, foo, fa, fo\") and in high-interest words (fish, fun, four, food).\n- Client demonstrated clearer lip-biting posture and airflow compared with baseline, with fewer substitutions to /p/.\n- Still needed reminders to \"bite your lip and blow\" but was able to self-correct in a few instances after hearing his own production.\n\nGoal 3: Final consonant marking in CVC words (p, m, t)\n- Practiced CVC words in imitation (e.g., map, mop, mat, mom, boat, hat) using visual cueing (pointing to final sound symbol) and slowed speech.\n- Some increased awareness of final sounds; client occasionally added a final consonant after a model when cued to \"add a sound at the end.\"\n- Overall consistency remains limited, but he showed more frequent attempts to close the word.\n\nGoal 4: Syllable shapes (CVCV alternating)\n- Elicited multisyllabic CVCV words (e.g., \"bunny, teddy, baby, happy\") in structured play.\n- Client produced most syllables, although some were reduced or blended together. With a clapping/tapping cue, he could mark both syllables more clearly.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue working on initial /s/ at the imitated word level, with gradual fading of cues as tolerated, as progress is emerging.\n- Maintain practice of /f/ in syllables and simple words with visual and tactile cueing, encouraging self-monitoring.\n- Parent encouraged to keep modeling final sounds and to play simple word games (e.g., \"I spy something that ends with /p/\") at a very easy level.\n- Next session: consider probing /s/ in short carrier phrases (\"my sun,\" \"big sock\") if word-level accuracy remains similar."

Responded well to visual schedules and clear expectations.\n\nGoals / session focus:\nGoal 1: Initial /s/ at word and emerging phrase level\n- Reviewed initial /s/ words in imitation (sun, sock, soup, sand, seat). Accuracy in imitation was noticeably improved compared with last week, with more consistent tongue placement and airflow.\n- Began to introduce short carrier phrases (\"my sun,\" \"big sock,\" \"see soup\") at an imitated level. Client was able to maintain /s/ in many phrase attempts when provided with a slow model.\n- Occasional distortions and omissions persisted, but overall productions were clearer and required fewer tactile cues.\n\nGoal 2: Initial /f/ in words and short phrases (imitation)\n- Practiced /f/ in familiar words (fish, four, fun, food, feet) and in simple imitated phrases (\"my feet,\" \"big fish\").\n- Accuracy at the word level was moderately improved, with more consistent use of the correct lip posture and airflow.\n- Needed verbal reminders less frequently; at times he initiated the lip-biting posture on his own when shown the picture.\n\nGoal 3: Final consonant production in CVC words (p, m, t)\n- Continued work on CVC words (map, mop, mat, mom, boat, hat) at the imitated level using visual and tactile cues (tapping the table for the final sound).\n- Client demonstrated more attempts to close words, particularly with final /p/ (e.g., \"ma[p]\") when prompted.\n- Final /m/ and /t/ remained more inconsistent; often omitted in spontaneous play, but some correct productions in structured practice.\n\nGoal 4: Multisyllabic CVCV words\n- Targeted CVCV words (e.g., bunny, baby, teddy, happy, cookie) during play-based activities.\n- Client was able to mark both syllables more often when using a clapping or marching cue. Some sound distortions and simplifications remained, but overall intelligibility for these words improved.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen initial /s/ and /f/ at the word level and expand use into short, imitated carrier phrases where accuracy is adequate.\n- Maintain focus on final consonant marking with high-frequency CVC words, using the tapping cue that parent can also try at home.\n- Provide parent with a small set of picture cards for /s/ and /f/ words and model a short practice routine (5 minutes, 3–4 times per week).\n- Next session: further probe phrase-level production for /s/ and /f/ and monitor consistency of final consonants."

Followed directions well and responded positively to specific praise about his speech.\n\nGoals / session focus:\nGoal 1: Initial /s/ in words, short phrases, and brief conversation\n- Continued structured spontaneous practice of /s/ in naming, simple story retell, and short conversational exchanges.\n- Accuracy at the word and phrase level remained consistent with recent sessions, with many correct /s/ productions in structured contexts and some variability in longer or more rapid speech.\n- Occasional cues were still helpful to maintain accuracy during more complex language tasks.\n\nGoal 2: Initial /f/ in words and short phrases\n- Practiced /f/ in functional words and phrases during play (e.g., \"more food,\" \"four fish,\" \"fun game\").\n- Performance was stable; he produced /f/ accurately in most structured opportunities and needed intermittent prompts when moving into more spontaneous speech.\n\nGoal 3: Final consonant production in CVC words (p, t, m) at word and phrase level\n- Targeted final consonants in a mix of imitation and structured spontaneous tasks, including short phrases and simple descriptions.\n- He continued to show consistent marking of final /p/ and /t/ in many practiced words and phrases with light cues. Final /m/ remained less consistent but is present in some key words (e.g., \"mom\").\n- Overall pattern was similar to last week, indicating consolidation of current skills.\n\nGoal 4: /s/ blends at the imitated word level\n- Practiced /s/ blends (spoon, star, stop, slide, snow) using direct imitation with visual and verbal cueing.\n- Client produced a small number of accurate blends; however, reductions and omissions were still frequent, and he continued to require maximal support.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue with current therapy plan to support consistent use of /s/ and /f/ in increasingly natural contexts and to further develop final consonant production.\n- /s/ blends will remain at the imitated word level until single /s/ and final consonants are more fully generalized.\n- Parent encouraged to keep sessions at home short, fun, and child-led, focusing on everyday opportunities to highlight target sounds.\n- Recommend ongoing weekly therapy to consolidate gains and support further generalization of speech sound skills."

She reported that speech \"sounds a bit unclear\" to unfamiliar listeners but family usually understands him.\n- No major changes since referral. Mom notices he often leaves off the ends of words (e.g., \"pi\" for \"pig\").\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- 4-year-old boy, transitioned to therapy room with brief hesitation, then separated from mom without difficulty.\n- Engaged well with toy farm and cars; needed occasional redirection from self-directed play back to speech tasks.\n- Participated in imitation tasks when activities were play-based and visually supported.\n\nGoals/Intervention Focus:\n1. Establish awareness of final consonants in CVC words (e.g., /p, m, t/)\n   - Targeted through picture naming and play (e.g., \"map,\" \"cup,\" \"ham,\" \"cat\").\n   - In imitation, client often omitted final consonants or added a vowel (e.g., \"ca-tuh\").\n   - With simultaneous production and visual cue of “closing the word,” he produced final /p, m, t/ accurately in a few trials but not yet consistent.\n\n2. Initial /k/ vs /t/ (fronting)\n   - Probed in isolation and simple CV syllables (\"kuh,\" \"kee,\" \"koo\") using tongue-back cues and visuals.\n   - Frequently substituted /t/ for /k/ at word level (e.g., \"tar\" for \"car\").\n   - Able to approximate /k/ in isolation with maximal verbal and visual cues and hand cue to “back sound” in about half of attempts.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in simple words\n   - Screened at word level during play (\"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"soap,\" \"sit\").\n   - Productions were variable: substitutions included /d/ and /z/, occasional omission of consonant.\n   - Client watched clinician’s mouth but needed frequent reminders to keep tongue behind teeth; no consistent independent productions yet.\n\n4. Overall speech sound inventory / baseline\n   - Informal play-based sampling suggested reduced intelligibility at phrase level, especially for unfamiliar listener.\n   - Patterns noted: final consonant deletion, stopping of some fricatives, and fronting of velars.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue weekly sessions focusing on final consonant production in simple CVC words and establishing a consistent /k/ in isolation and CV syllables.\n- Encourage parent to emphasize final sounds in everyday words (e.g., “cuP,” “caT”) using slow, clear models without asking child to repeat every time.\n- Next session: begin structured practice for final /p, m, t/ at imitated word level and continue shaping /k/ in isolation."

She notices he sometimes corrects himself when she repeats a word with a strong final sound.\n- Family has been trying to slow down their own speech and emphasize word endings as discussed.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Smooth transition into therapy room; greeted clinician spontaneously.\n- Remained seated at the table for short activities, then preferred floor-based play. Responded well to alternating between structured tasks and play breaks.\n- Good overall participation with minimal frustration; accepted cues and feedback.\n\nGoals/Intervention Focus:\n1. Final consonants /p, m, t/ in CVC words (imitation)\n   - Practiced with picture cards and toy food (\"cup,\" \"cap,\" \"ham,\" \"map,\" \"cat,\" \"hat\").\n   - With simultaneous production and visual cue (tapping for the last sound), he produced clearer final consonants more frequently than last session.\n   - Still tended to add a vowel or drop the final consonant without support; accuracy improved when clinician slowed the word and drew attention to the “last sound.”\n\n2. /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n   - Continued tongue-back practice using mirror, picture of tongue position, and “cough sound” cue.\n   - Achieved several good /k/ sounds in isolation with maximal verbal and visual cues.\n   - CV syllables (\"koo,\" \"kay,\" \"kee\") were emerging; often reverted to /t/ at the start, but a few approximations of /k/ at the syllable level were observed with heavy support.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in simple words (imitated)\n   - Targeted limited set of words (\"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"soap\") at the imitation level.\n   - Client continued to show variable productions; some close approximations of /s/ when given cue to “make the long snake sound” and keep teeth together.\n   - Still requires frequent modeling and verbal cueing; not yet consistent at word level.\n\n4. Functional phrases for clarity\n   - During play, clinician modeled short 2–3 word phrases with emphasized final sounds (\"big cup,\" \"red hat\").\n   - Child imitated several short phrases but often reduced endings; some attempts to self-correct when clinician repeated with emphasis.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue at current levels: imitated CVC words for final /p, m, t/ and /k/ in isolation/CV.\n- Encourage caregiver to play simple “listening games” at home: noticing when words end with a “p” or “t” sound.\n- Next session: build consistency for final /p, m, t/ and continue shaping /k/ toward more reliable CV productions."

Final consonants /p, m, t/ in CVC words (imitation → cued independent)\n   - Practiced with picture cards and a simple board game.\n   - With a verbal cue only (no simultaneous production), client produced clearer final /p, m, t/ in many trials.\n   - Emerging ability to produce final consonants after a model and then on a second trial with reduced cues; still occasional omissions, but overall accuracy and consistency notably improved from prior session.\n\n2. /k/ in isolation and CV syllables (progressing)\n   - Used mirror work and “cough sound” cue followed by shaping into “car,” “key,” “cow.”\n   - Able to produce /k/ in isolation with moderate cues more consistently.\n   - In CV syllables, produced initial /k/ correctly or closely approximated in a higher proportion of attempts; occasional /t/ substitutions persist but fewer than last session.\n\n3. Initial /k/ in single words (imitated)\n   - Trialed simple words (\"car,\" \"key,\" \"cow\") at the imitated word level.\n   - Needed verbal reminders to “use the back sound”; showed several correct or near-correct productions when focused.\n   - This represents a step up from prior sessions, where /k/ was mostly limited to isolation.\n\n4. Initial /s/ in simple words (imitated)\n   - Revisited small set of words (\"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"soap\").\n   - Child produced more consistent initial fricative-like sounds with cue to “keep tongue behind teeth and blow slowly.”\n   - Some substitutions remain, but more attempts at a true /s/ and better differentiation from /d/.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to consolidate final consonants at the imitated word level and begin to check for carryover into short phrases (e.g., \"red cup\").\n- Increase practice of /k/ at the imitated word level with visual cues.\n- Home: parent to pick 3–4 “practice words” (e.g., cup, cat, map) and model slowly, encouraging child to try once or twice without pressure.\n- Next session: expand /k/ word set and monitor for readiness to try short carrier phrases with strong final consonants."

Final consonants /p, m, t/ in CVC words (word → short phrase level)\n   - Reviewed imitated CVC words, then moved into short, structured phrases (e.g., \"red cup,\" \"big map,\" \"my cat\").\n   - At word level, client produced final /p, m, t/ with relatively good consistency when given a light verbal reminder.\n   - In short phrases, some final consonants were dropped again, but with a quick cue to “finish the word,” he was often able to repair the production.\n\n2. /k/ initial in words (imitation)\n   - Practiced \"car,\" \"key,\" \"cow,\" \"cup\" using picture cards and car play.\n   - Demonstrated more consistent use of a back-of-the-tongue sound when cued; fewer /t/ substitutions than previous sessions.\n   - Still requires moderate visual/verbal cues and slower rate, but accuracy at the imitated word level is improving.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words (imitation; emerging phrases)\n   - Continued with \"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"soap,\" and introduced \"sit\" in a game context.\n   - Produced more recognizable /s/ sounds at the start of words with cues to “keep teeth closed” and “long sound.”\n   - Trialed simple phrase \"bye sun\" and \"see sock\" with mixed accuracy; needed modeling and reminders but attempted to maintain the /s/.\n\n4. Functional intelligibility in play\n   - In spontaneous play, client used many 2–4 word utterances; speech remained variably intelligible, but some words with final consonants and /k/ appeared more clearly when they had just been practiced.\n   - Occasional self-corrections observed after clinician repeated the word with emphasis.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen final consonant production in both single words and short carrier phrases.\n- Maintain focus on /k/ initial words at the imitated level; consider expanding to a few new /k/ words as accuracy stabilizes.\n- Home: parent to use simple phrases (\"big cup,\" \"my cat\") and gently highlight the last sound.\n- Next session: continue same goals, watching for increasing independence before moving to more spontaneous phrase-level use."

Final consonants /p, m, t/ in CVC words and phrases (maintenance)\n   - Practiced sets of familiar words in isolation and short phrases.\n   - Accuracy patterns mirrored previous weeks: solid at imitated word level, more variable in connected speech.\n   - Able to correct when prompted; spontaneous use of final consonants remained inconsistent but present in some practiced words.\n\n2. /k/ initial in words and short phrases\n   - Continued with established /k/ word list within simple games.\n   - Performance stable, with many correct /k/ productions in imitation and a few in spontaneous play with familiar words.\n   - Still not fully generalized across contexts.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words (imitated)\n   - Revisited core /s/ words in a matching game.\n   - Productions and cueing needs were similar to recent sessions; some accurate /s/ when fully focused and cued.\n\n4. Functional communication and self-awareness\n   - In play, child occasionally asked for feedback (\"Was that good?\") and seemed aware when clinician highlighted \"strong endings\" and \"back sounds.\"\n   - Intelligibility remained reduced in longer utterances, but motivation to improve is evident.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue with current targets to allow ongoing consolidation while planning next steps.\n- Home: discuss with parent strategies to embed practice into routines (e.g., choosing a \"word of the day\" to say with strong endings) rather than formal drills only.\n- Next session: review progress across block and collaboratively plan future therapy focus with caregiver."

Final consonants /p, m, t/ in CVC words and short phrases (review)\n   - Conducted a brief review of final consonant targets using picture naming and short phrases.\n   - Accuracy remained stable compared with recent sessions: generally strong at imitated word level, with ongoing variability in phrases.\n   - Demonstrated consistent ability to self-correct with minimal prompting when errors were highlighted.\n\n2. /k/ initial in words and short phrases (review)\n   - Reviewed common /k/ words (\"car,\" \"key,\" \"cow,\" \"cup,\" \"coat\").\n   - Accuracy at the imitated word level stayed similar to prior weeks; some spontaneous correct /k/ noted during play.\n   - Continued to require occasional reminders to keep the \"back sound\" in connected speech.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words (imitated)\n   - Reassessed /s/ in a small set of words.\n   - Productions and cueing needs remained consistent with previous notes; accurate /s/ possible with direct cues, but not yet generalized.\n\n4. Summary of current speech profile\n   - Child has made meaningful gains in awareness and production of final consonants and /k/ at the word level over the course of the block.\n   - Intelligibility in spontaneous conversation remains reduced, with persistent phonological patterns and limited generalization of new skills beyond practiced contexts.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Recommend continuation of speech-language therapy to further support generalization of final consonants and /k/ to phrases and conversation, and to continue work on /s/ production.\n- Home: encourage daily, brief practice focusing on a small set of high-impact words with final consonants and /k/, using slow, clear models and positive feedback.\n- Next block: consider maintaining current targets while gradually increasing phrase/sentence complexity for well-established words and exploring additional sound patterns as appropriate."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\nMother attended today and reported that she and other family members continue to have difficulty understanding child’s speech, especially with longer words and when he is excited. She noted that he is starting to notice when others do not understand him and will sometimes repeat louder instead of changing his sounds.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nChild transitioned into the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from mother without tears. He was curious about the toys and participated best in play-based activities. Attention was variable; needed several gentle redirections back to speech tasks but remained generally cooperative.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Establish production of /k/ in isolation and simple syllables (CV, VC)\n- Baseline probe completed. Child frequently substituted /t/ for /k/ in both play and structured tasks (e.g., \"tar\" for \"car\").\n- In isolation, he was inconsistently able to produce a backed sound approximating /k/ with maximal verbal and visual cues (e.g., “tongue up and back,” use of mirror). Accuracy was low and required repeated modeling.\n- CV and VC syllables (e.g., \"ku,\" \"ik\"): productions were mostly /t/ or omitted. Occasional close approximations when clinician used exaggerated mouth model and slowed rate.\n\n2. Establish production of /f/ in isolation\n- Baseline indicated frequent stopping of /f/ to /p/ in both initial and final positions.\n- In isolation trials, child was able to imitate a weak /f/ sound in a few attempts with direct modeling, mirror, and “bite your lip, blow” instruction, but often reverted to /p/ or silent blowing.\n\n3. Observe overall consonant accuracy in simple CVC words\n- Informal play-based sample revealed patterns of fronting (/k, g/→/t, d/) and stopping of fricatives (/s, f/→/t, p/). Final consonants were sometimes omitted in spontaneous speech.\n- Intelligibility in familiar context (with clinician after some exposure) was judged to be fair; required frequent clarification requests.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to focus on establishing /k/ and /f/ in isolation with high levels of visual and verbal cueing.\n- Introduce simple CV syllables for /k/ as tolerated.\n- Encourage caregiver to model slow, clear speech at home and emphasize sounds in fun routines (e.g., “car,” “go,” “off”) without pressuring for imitation."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\nMother stated there were “no big changes” in speech since last week. She has been trying to use the mirror at home as suggested, but child is mostly interested for short periods. She notices he occasionally tries to copy her “car” model but still sounds like “tar.”\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nChild separated from mother more easily and entered the room willingly. He engaged well with car and animal toys and allowed the clinician to incorporate speech practice into play. Attention to adult-directed tasks was slightly better than last session, with fewer redirections needed.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Compared to baseline, child showed moderate, meaningful progress with /k/ in isolation. With visual model and verbal cues, he produced a clearer /k/ in approximately half of attempts, rather than mostly /t/ as last session.\n- Introduced CV syllables (e.g., \"ku,\" \"ka\"). Child was able to approximate /k/ at the start of the syllable with maximal support (mirror, “tongue back,” tactile cue on throat to feel \"back sound\"). Accuracy was emerging but improved relative to last week.\n\n2. /f/ in isolation and initial CV syllables\n- Child demonstrated more consistent airflow for /f/ with direct modeling and cues to “bite lip and blow.” Several good productions were noted in isolation, though he still reverted to /p/ without reminders.\n- Introduced initial CV syllables (e.g., \"fee,\" \"foo\"). Child produced a recognizable /f/ in some imitated CVs with continued maximal cueing.\n\n3. Initial /k/ at word level (imitated)\n- Trialed a few simple words (e.g., \"car,\" \"key\") following success at syllable level. Child typically produced /t/ initially but showed a few improved attempts with a backed consonant when the word was heavily segmented and practiced slowly.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to build consistency for /k/ and /f/ in isolation and CV syllables.\n- Briefly trial initial /k/ at the imitated word level in highly familiar words (e.g., \"car\") when accuracy is strong in syllables.\n- Caregiver to keep practice brief and positive at home, focusing on a few fun words rather than long drill lists."

He participated well in structured play activities and tolerated short bursts of more direct practice at the table. Needed occasional breaks but returned to tasks with minimal prompting.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. /k/ in isolation, CV, and VC syllables\n- Child now produces /k/ in isolation more consistently with moderate verbal and visual cues rather than maximal. Accuracy and clarity of the sound were noticeably better than last session.\n- In CV and VC combinations (e.g., \"ku,\" \"ak,\" \"ik\"), child produced a recognizable /k/ in many attempts when given a slow model and mirror. Occasional /t/ substitutions still occurred, but he responded well to reminders to “make the sound in the back.”\n\n2. Initial /k/ at the imitated word level\n- Practiced words: \"car, key, cow, cookie.\" With segmented modeling and cues, child produced initial /k/ correctly in a portion of trials, more than last week.\n- He demonstrated some emerging self-correction when he heard himself say \"tar\" and tried again with support.\n\n3. /f/ in isolation and initial CV syllables\n- Continued focus on lip placement and airflow. Child produced /f/ in isolation with improved consistency, requiring mainly verbal reminders.\n- In CV syllables (e.g., \"fee,\" \"fa\"), he achieved clearer /f/ onset in several trials. Occasional stopping to /p/ persisted, but he accepted correction and tried again.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen /k/ and /f/ at isolation and syllable levels while gradually increasing practice at initial word level for /k/ in a small, functional set of words.\n- Encourage caregiver to praise attempts and gently model corrections (e.g., “I heard ‘tar,’ let’s try ‘car’ together”)."

            "note_text": "Parent/caregiver report:\n- Mother reported that child is starting junior kindergarten in the fall and is “hard to understand” for unfamiliar adults. No history of hearing concerns. She notices that he often leaves off sounds at the ends of words and says “doo” for “zoo.” No major changes since initial assessment.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance. Once settled, he was curious and engaged in play-based activities (cars, farm set). Attention span was variable; needed occasional redirection back to speech tasks but responded well to visual supports and short activities.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Practiced final consonants in simple words (e.g., “cup, cap, cat, hat, map, mom”) at the imitated word level.\n- Child frequently omitted the final sound or replaced it with a neutral vowel (e.g., “cu-,” “ma-”).\n- With simultaneous production and visual cueing (pointing to mouth, touching picture of “end sound”), he was able to mark some final sounds, but consistency was low and required maximal modeling.\n\n2) Initial /k/ in syllables and simple words\n- Targeted /k/ in isolation and CV syllables (“ku, ki, ka”) using a “back sound” cue (tongue up and back).\n- Child often substituted /t/ for /k/ in words (e.g., “tar” for “car”).\n- With hand-under-chin cue and mirror, he could approximate /k/ in isolation in several attempts but had difficulty carrying this into words without full modeling.\n\n3) Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Introduced “snake sound” /s/ in isolation and in simple syllables (“see, soo”).\n- Child produced a mix of /d/ and /th/ substitutions, with occasional accurate /s/ when watching clinician’s mouth closely.\n- Required frequent verbal reminders (“keep your tongue behind your teeth, blow air”) and benefited from tactile cue on the sides of his mouth.\n\n4) Functional communication / speech sample\n- Collected brief language sample during play. Child used mainly 2–3 word combinations (“my car,” “more bubbles,” “I want that”).\n- Intelligibility decreased as utterances got longer; caregiver often interpreted for clinician.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to target final consonant production at CVC word level with maximal supports.\n- Maintain focus on establishing consistent /k/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables before moving to more complex words.\n- Home practice: caregiver to model clear final sounds in everyday words (e.g., “up, cup, hot, bed”) and encourage slow, clear repetition without pressure for perfection.\n- Monitor attention and continue using short, play-based tasks with frequent breaks."

She notices child sometimes adds a sound at the end if she slows down and emphasizes it, but this is not yet consistent. She continues to be the main person who understands him.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered the room more readily today and appeared comfortable with clinician. He was eager to choose toys and participated well in structured play. Some silliness when tasks became more challenging, but responded to visual schedule and turn-taking games.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final consonant production in CVC words (/p, t, m/)\n- Revisited final consonants at imitated word level using picture cards and a simple “end sound” game.\n- Compared to last week, child more consistently attempted to close words with a sound, though accuracy remained variable.\n- With moderate verbal and visual cues (pointing to end of word on card, pausing before final sound), he produced clearer final /p/ and /t/ in several trials, with fewer complete omissions.\n\n2) Initial /k/ in CV and CVC words\n- Practiced /k/ in CV syllables (“ku, ki, ko”) and expanded to a small set of words (e.g., “car, key, cow”).\n- Child produced more accurate /k/ in isolation and syllables than previous session with less need for simultaneous production.\n- In words, he still showed frequent /t/ substitutions but demonstrated a few independent correct /k/ productions when given a “back sound” reminder only.\n\n3) Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on “snake sound” /s/ with mirror and visual cue (snake picture).\n- Child showed slightly increased accuracy in isolation, sustaining a clearer /s/ for longer durations.\n- In simple syllables (“see, soo”), he was able to imitate /s/ in a small number of trials with close modeling; still required maximal cueing for tongue placement.\n\n4) Functional play-based speech\n- During play, child used short phrases (2–3 words) spontaneously (e.g., “my turn,” “more bubbles,” “car go”).\n- Final consonants were still frequently omitted in spontaneous speech, but occasional marked endings were noted when clinician modeled just prior.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue current targets, as skills are just beginning to emerge and benefit from repetition.\n- Next session, consider introducing a simple final consonant “listening” game to build awareness of when words have an ending sound.\n- Home practice: caregiver to continue slow, emphasized final sounds in familiar words, and play a simple “same or different” game (e.g., “cu” vs. “cup”) to highlight endings without expecting perfect repetition."

He maintained attention for longer stretches this session and was more willing to repeat words when prompted. Minimal avoidance; responded well to praise and sticker rewards.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final consonant production in CVC words (/p, t, m/; imitation and early cued independence)\n- Used picture cards and a simple board game to elicit CVC words (e.g., “cup, cap, cat, map, mat, mop”).\n- Child showed a noticeable increase in attempts to close words with final sounds, with fewer complete omissions.\n- With moderate verbal cues and occasional visual prompts, he produced clearer final /p/ and /t/ in many trials, and began to self-correct when he heard his own omissions.\n- Began to trial a few productions with reduced cueing; he was sometimes able to produce final /p/ independently after one modeled attempt.\n\n2) Initial /k/ at word level\n- Targeted /k/ in initial position of familiar words (“car, key, cow, cookie”) within a car-race game.\n- Child produced more accurate /k/ in imitation, needing fewer simultaneous productions and less tactile support.\n- Showed several instances of independent /k/ in words after a brief reminder to “use your back sound,” indicating improved motor planning for this phoneme.\n\n3) Initial /s/ in syllables and early word level\n- Practiced /s/ in CV syllables and moved into a small set of words (“sun, soap, sock”) at the imitated word level.\n- Child demonstrated improved ability to sustain /s/ in isolation and was more consistent in shaping /s/ rather than /d/ or /th/.\n- At word level, he still required high levels of support (mirror, verbal placement cues), but there were more clearly correct productions than in previous sessions.\n\n4) Functional carryover of final consonants\n- During structured play, clinician modeled short phrases with final consonants (e.g., “big cup,” “hot dog”).\n- Child occasionally carried over final /p/ and /t/ into short phrases when immediately modeled, suggesting early generalization from single words to simple combinations.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Given emerging accuracy, continue CVC final consonant work at word level and gradually fade cueing when possible.\n- For /k/, begin to trial short carrier phrases (e.g., “my car,” “go cow”) in upcoming sessions if word-level accuracy remains strong.\n- For /s/, continue to solidify isolation and syllable-level production before expanding word lists.\n- Home practice: caregiver to practice 5–8 CVC words with child daily, focusing on clear end sounds, using picture cards or objects at home (e.g., cup, hat, bed, map)."

Intelligibility with unfamiliar listeners remains limited.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered session with good energy and quickly engaged with the chosen game. Attention was sustained for structured tasks with brief movement breaks. He showed pride when he produced words accurately and occasionally requested, “my turn more,” indicating good engagement.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final consonants in CVC words (/p, t, m, n/; imitation → cued independence)\n- Expanded final consonant work to include /n/ in addition to /p, t, m/ using picture cards and a simple “feed the puppet” game.\n- Child demonstrated clearer and more consistent marking of final consonants compared to previous sessions, particularly for /p/ and /t/.\n- With moderate cues, he produced many accurate CVC words; in some familiar items (e.g., “cup, cat, map”), he required only a light verbal reminder or none at all, indicating readiness to begin fading supports.\n\n2) Initial /k/ in words and short carrier phrases\n- Practiced initial /k/ words (“car, key, cow, cookie”) and introduced short carrier phrases (e.g., “my car,” “big cow”) at the imitated level.\n- Child maintained improved /k/ accuracy at word level with less cueing and was able to produce several correct /k/ sounds within short phrases when modeled.\n- Some reversion to /t/ was observed when phrases became longer, but he responded to brief reminders to “use your back sound.”\n\n3) Initial /s/ at word level\n- Continued work on /s/ in words (“sun, soap, sock, soup”) using a “snake sound” visual and mirror.\n- Child produced a greater proportion of accurate /s/ in imitation, although substitutions (/d/, /th/) still occurred.\n- He began to accept fewer tactile cues and responded better to simple verbal prompts and visual supports, showing moderate improvement in consistency.\n\n4) Early phrase-level practice with final consonants\n- Introduced short 2–3 word phrases that combined final consonants with high-interest nouns (e.g., “big cup,” “hot soup”) in imitation.\n- Child was able to mark some final sounds within these phrases when provided with a clear model and slowed rate, though accuracy was lower than at single-word level.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to consolidate CVC final consonant accuracy; if consistency remains high, gradually increase the number of phrase-level trials next session.\n- Maintain initial /k/ practice in short carrier phrases and begin to increase variety of /k/ words.\n- Continue structured /s/ word practice; may trial limited /s/ blends in future once single /s/ is more stable.\n- Home practice: caregiver to model and practice 2-word phrases with final consonants (e.g., “big cup,” “red hat”) during daily routines, focusing on slow, clear speech."

Motivation remained good when activities were game-like and varied.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final consonants in CVC words and short phrases (/p, t, m, n/)\n- Practiced a set of familiar and new CVC words and short phrases (e.g., “big cup,” “red hat,” “green map”) at imitated and cued independent levels.\n- Accuracy and consistency were similar to prior session, with strong performance at the single-word level and variable but functional performance in short phrases.\n- Child continued to respond well to light verbal cues to “finish the word,” without clear additional reduction in cueing needs this week.\n\n2) Initial /k/ in phrases and short sentences\n- Continued practice of initial /k/ words in carrier phrases and brief sentences (“I see a car,” “Big cow go up”) at the imitated level.\n- Child maintained good /k/ accuracy in phrases and showed some correct productions in short sentences, though still needed modeling and occasional reminders.\n- Performance was in line with previous sessions.\n\n3) Initial /s/ in words and simple phrases\n- Repeated /s/ words and 2-word phrases with visual and verbal placement cues.\n- Accuracy remained relatively stable, with some clear /s/ productions and ongoing inconsistency.\n- No major change in independence or cueing level was observed.\n\n4) Functional communication and overall intelligibility\n- During structured play, child used a variety of short phrases and a few longer utterances. Intelligibility within the session was improved compared to the start of the block but consistent with the past several weeks.\n- Target sounds (/k/, final consonants) appeared more frequently in his spontaneous speech for practiced words, though not yet generalized broadly.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue with current therapy focus in subsequent block, emphasizing:\n  • Further strengthening of final consonant production in phrases and early sentences.\n  • Ongoing practice of initial /k/ in increasingly natural sentence contexts.\n  • Continued development of consistent /s/ production at word and phrase levels.\n- Home practice: caregiver to keep integrating target words/phrases into everyday routines and to provide specific praise when child uses clear final sounds and accurate /k/ or /s/ in natural conversation.\n- Consider re-assessing goal hierarchy at the start of next block to determine readiness for more consistent sentence-level work and potential addition of new targets (e.g., /s/ blends) as appropriate."
