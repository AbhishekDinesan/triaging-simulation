            "note_text": "Session 1\n\nParent/Caregiver Report:\n- Parent reported that child is “hard to understand” for unfamiliar listeners and often leaves off sounds at the ends of words. No prior speech therapy. Parent notices that /k/ and /g/ are usually replaced with /t/ and /d/ (e.g., “tat” for “cat”).\n- No major changes in speech over the past few months per parent; family is motivated to start home practice.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- 4-year-old child transitioned to the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from parent with reassurance.\n- Once settled, child engaged well in play-based activities and followed simple directions. Attention was best with hands-on toys and picture books. Occasional silliness when tasks became more challenging, but generally redirectable.\n\nTherapy Goals & Observations:\nGoal 1: Establish /k/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Baseline probing showed consistent fronting of /k/ to /t/ in all positions.\n- With direct modeling and visual cues (showing “back tongue” in mirror), child was able to approximate /k/ in isolation in a few trials; productions were often “t-k” or very light contact.\n- In CV syllables (e.g., “koo, kah”), accuracy was low; child reverted to /t/ most of the time. Required maximal verbal and visual cueing.\n\nGoal 2: Establish /g/ in isolation\n- Similar pattern of fronting /g/ to /d/. In isolation, child produced a few close approximations of /g/ with simultaneous modeling.\n- Needed repeated reminders to “lift tongue at the back” and to keep lips relaxed. Accuracy remained inconsistent.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /k/ at imitated word level (emerging)\n- Probed initial /k/ in simple words (e.g., “key, cow, car, cookie”). Child mostly produced /t/ (e.g., “tee” for “key”).\n- With maximal modeling, segmentation (“k—ey”), and tactile cue under chin, child produced a few clearer /k/ sounds, but not yet consistent.\n\nGoal 4: Final consonant production (p, m, t) in CVC words\n- Screening during play showed frequent omission of final consonants (e.g., “bee” for “beep,” “boo” for “boom”).\n- With model and visual cue (pointing to mouth for “end sound”), child could sometimes add a final /p/ or /m/, but needed frequent repetition and support.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to focus on establishing /k/ and /g/ in isolation and simple syllables before moving more fully to word level.\n- Introduce simple final consonant practice with high-interest words.\n- Home practice: parent to model “back sounds” /k, g/ in a mirror for short, playful practice (1–2 minutes), emphasizing listening and watching rather than pushing for perfection.\n- Next session: recheck /k/ and /g/ in isolation and CV syllables; continue to probe final consonants in CVC words."

Needed occasional breaks with toys between drill tasks.\n\nTherapy Goals & Observations:\nGoal 1: /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Marked breakthrough compared to last week. With verbal cue (“tongue in the back”) and mirror, child produced a clear /k/ in isolation in most attempts.\n- In CV combinations (e.g., “koo, kah, kee”), accuracy improved notably. Child was able to maintain the back tongue position with moderate verbal cueing and occasional visual reminder.\n\nGoal 2: /g/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- /g/ also more accurate today. Child produced several good /g/ sounds in isolation with model.\n- In CV syllables (“goo, gah, gee”), productions were mixed; some reverted to /d/, but there were more successful trials than last session.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /k/ at imitated word level\n- Practiced simple words (key, cow, car, cookie, cat). Child more consistently initiated words with a recognizable /k/ when given a slow model and cue to “start with the back sound.”\n- Still needed moderate support, but accuracy was noticeably better than baseline.\n\nGoal 4: Final /p, m/ in CVC words (imitated)\n- Targeted final consonants in high-interest words (pop, beep, boom, mom).\n- With modeling and a visual cue (touching chin for end sound), child was able to add final /p/ and /m/ more often than last session, though omissions still occurred.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue strengthening /k/ and /g/ in CV syllables and initial word position, aiming for more automatic productions.\n- Maintain short, fun final consonant practice.\n- Home practice: parent to use a few target words (e.g., key, cow, pop, mom) and emphasize the “back sound” and the “end sound,” praising any attempts.\n- Next session: consider expanding initial /k/ to a small set of words in simple carrier phrases if accuracy remains strong."

Parent feels they are noticing the errors more now.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child separated easily from parent and was eager to choose toys.\n- Maintained attention well with turn-taking games. Some playful avoidance (e.g., silly answers) when tasks became more repetitive, but responded to choices and praise.\n\nTherapy Goals & Observations:\nGoal 1: /k/ in CV and VC syllables\n- Child produced /k/ in CV syllables with good consistency when given a model and brief reminder. Accuracy has increased since last week, requiring slightly fewer cues.\n- Introduced VC syllables (e.g., “ak, ick, ook”); child was able to mark the final /k/ in some attempts but often omitted or fronted it.\n\nGoal 2: Initial /k/ at word level (imitation and early spontaneous attempts)\n- Practiced initial /k/ words (key, cow, car, cookie, cat, coat) in picture naming.\n- In imitation, productions were more consistent, with clearer back tongue placement; fewer /t/ substitutions.\n- Child occasionally used /k/ spontaneously during play (e.g., “car go”), though not yet reliable.\n\nGoal 3: Initial /g/ in isolation and CV\n- /g/ remains more challenging than /k/ but showed some improvement.\n- In isolation, child could produce /g/ with model and visual cue; still occasional /d/ substitutions.\n- In CV syllables (goo, gah, gee), child had emerging accuracy with frequent reminders.\n\nGoal 4: Final /p, m, t/ in CVC words\n- Continued work on final consonants (pop, beep, boom, bat, bed, mom).\n- With modeling and gesture cues, child more frequently included the final sound, though not yet consistent.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen /k/ in CV/VC and initial word positions; begin to incorporate simple carrier phrases with support if accuracy holds (e.g., “my car,” “big cookie”).\n- Maintain practice with /g/ and final consonants at the word level with cues.\n- Home practice: encourage short practice of a few /k/ words in a simple phrase (e.g., “my car”), accepting approximations and praising effort.\n- Next session: monitor readiness to increase phrase-level practice for /k/ in structured tasks."

Needed fewer prompts to use the back tongue.\n- Introduced simple carrier phrases (e.g., “my car,” “big cookie,” “red coat”) with visual supports. Child was able to produce several phrases with reasonably clear /k/ in initial position, especially when given a slow model.\n\nGoal 2: /k/ in VC and CVC syllable shapes\n- Practiced VC syllables (ak, ick, oak, ook) and simple CVC words (back, book, bike).\n- Child more frequently marked the final /k/ with verbal and gestural cueing, though omissions still occurred.\n\nGoal 3: /g/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued to target /g/ in isolation and simple CV (goo, gah, go).\n- Child showed slightly better accuracy and was able to hold the back tongue position with moderate cueing, but /g/ remains less stable than /k/.\n\nGoal 4: Final /p, t/ in CVC words\n- Focused on a small set of high-interest CVC words (pop, up, hat, cat, hot).\n- With modeling and a visual cue for the “end sound,” child included final consonants more often than not in structured practice. Still tends to drop them in spontaneous speech.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to build phrase-level practice for initial /k/ in structured tasks while maintaining accuracy.\n- Ongoing work on /g/ and final consonants, with emphasis on listening and self-awareness.\n- Home practice: parent to use a few target phrases (e.g., “my car,” “big cookie”) during daily routines and reinforce any attempts at the back sound.\n- Next session: consider expanding /k/ targets to include more varied vowels and positions as accuracy stabilizes."

Needed more frequent movement breaks between tasks.\n- Still participated in activities, though attention span for drill was slightly shorter than previous sessions.\n\nTherapy Goals & Observations:\nGoal 1: Initial /k/ at word and phrase level\n- At the imitated word level, accuracy for initial /k/ remained generally similar to last week. Child continued to produce /k/ correctly in familiar words with moderate cueing.\n- In short carrier phrases (“my car,” “big cookie,” “go car”), child could produce several accurate phrases with support, but there was not a noticeable increase in independence.\n\nGoal 2: /k/ in VC and CVC forms\n- VC syllables (ak, ick, ook) and CVC words (back, book, bike) practiced again.\n- Performance was stable; child marked the final /k/ in some trials but still omitted it frequently without direct prompting.\n\nGoal 3: /g/ in isolation and CV\n- Continued work on /g/ with mirror and verbal cues.\n- Accuracy was comparable to last week. Child produced some good /g/ sounds in isolation but still defaulted to /d/ without strong support.\n\nGoal 4: Final /p, t/ in CVC words\n- Practiced pop, up, hat, hot, cat.\n- Child’s production of final consonants appeared similar to previous session, with good success when closely supported and frequent omissions in less structured attempts.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Maintain current level of practice for /k/ and /g/ while consolidating skills; no major changes to hierarchy this week.\n- Reinforce final consonant awareness through short, fun games (e.g., listening for “end sounds”).\n- Home practice: encourage brief daily practice using picture cards or toys for 5 minutes, focusing on a small set of /k/ words and final consonant words.\n- Next session: reassess readiness to increase independence at phrase level for /k/ and consider introducing new contexts if performance strengthens."

Family practicing some target words from previous block (e.g., “sun,” “sock”) informally.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child transitioned to therapy room with brief hesitation but joined session with encouragement.\n- Engaged well in floor play and turn-taking games; occasional distraction by toys but redirected with visual supports and clear expectations.\n- Responded best to short, play-based tasks with frequent movement breaks.\n\nGoals/Activities:\n1. Initial /s/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation using visual cue for “snake sound.” Child approximated /s/ with intermittent lateral airflow; about half of attempts were clearly /s/.\n- At CV syllable level (e.g., “see,” “sue,” “sah”), child required simultaneous production with SLP and moderate verbal and gestural cueing.\n- At simple word level (e.g., “sun,” “sock,” “soap”), productions were inconsistent; frequent substitutions with /d/ (“dun” for “sun”).\n\n2. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Introduced “lip-bite” cue and mirror for /f/ sound. Child was able to imitate /f/ in isolation in several trials with visual model, though often added a vowel (“fuh”).\n- In CV syllables (e.g., “fee,” “foo”), accuracy decreased; child sometimes produced /p/ or omitted the fricative portion.\n\n3. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, m/)\n- Targeted final /p/ and /m/ in simple words (e.g., “cup,” “up,” “mom,” “ham”) at the imitated word level.\n- Child frequently omitted final consonants in spontaneous speech; with direct imitation and tactile cue (light tap on table for “ending sound”), produced clearer final consonants in several attempts but not consistently.\n\n4. Two-word combinations with clear target words\n- During structured play, encouraged short phrases such as “my sun,” “big sock,” and “more soap.”\n- Child primarily produced single-word approximations; needed direct models and imitation to include both words.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to establish consistent production of /s/ and /f/ in isolation and simple syllables before moving up the hierarchy.\n- Encourage parents to practice “snake sound /s/” and “lip-bite /f/” in front of a mirror for short periods, keeping practice playful and brief.\n- Next session: revisit initial /s/ and /f/ in isolation and syllables; continue to monitor final consonant use in play-based tasks."

Initial /s/ in isolation, syllables, and simple words (imitation)\n- Child produced /s/ in isolation with improved consistency when given the visual “snake” cue and reminder to keep tongue behind teeth; majority of attempts were clearly /s/.\n- At CV level (e.g., “see,” “sah,” “soo”), accuracy increased compared to last session; able to imitate most targets with only brief verbal prompts.\n- At word level (e.g., “sun,” “sock,” “soap,” “sit”), child demonstrated more consistent productions in imitation, with fewer substitutions to /d/.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)\n- Continued to use mirror and “lip-bite” explanation. Child showed better control of airflow and lip placement.\n- In isolation, /f/ was clear in many attempts, with reduced tendency to add an extra vowel.\n- In CV syllables (e.g., “fee,” “foe”), accuracy improved; fewer substitutions to /p/ were noted.\n\n3. Final consonant production in CVC words (/p, m/)\n- Practiced final /p/ and /m/ in words such as “cup,” “up,” “ham,” and “mom” with visual cueing (e.g., pointing to a picture of the “end sound”).\n- Child produced final consonants more reliably in direct imitation, though still tended to drop them in spontaneous play.\n\n4. Two-word combinations featuring target sounds (imitation)\n- Modeled short phrases like “see sun,” “my sock,” “big cup” during shared play.\n- Child imitated several two-word phrases with clearer target sounds when provided with a slow, emphasized model.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Given the noticeable improvement with /s/ and /f/ in structured imitation, plan to gradually increase word-level practice next week and begin to trial very simple carrier phrases as appropriate.\n- Caregiver encouraged to continue short daily practice, focusing on a few favorite words (e.g., “sun,” “feet,” “fun”) and praising effort rather than accuracy."

Initial /s/ at word and emerging phrase level\n- Practiced initial /s/ words (“sun,” “sock,” “soap,” “sand,” “see”) in imitation and then in a simple game (e.g., feeding pictures to a puppet).\n- Accuracy at imitated word level was noticeably higher than last week; only occasional substitutions to /d/.\n- Introduced short carrier phrases (“my sun,” “see sock”) with models. Child was able to imitate several 2-word combinations with reasonably clear /s/ when cued to slow down.\n\n2. Initial /f/ at word level (imitation)\n- Targeted /f/ in words such as “feet,” “fish,” “phone,” “fun.”\n- Child used correct lip and teeth placement more consistently; fewer productions were stopped to /p/.\n- Some independent attempts to say /f/ words during play (e.g., “fish”) without prompting, though accuracy varied.\n\n3. Final consonant production in CVC words (/p, m, t/)\n- Expanded targets to include final /t/ (e.g., “hat,” “boat”) while maintaining /p/ and /m/ from previous sessions.\n- In imitation, child produced final consonants with moderate success, especially when SLP used a gesture to mark the end sound.\n- In spontaneous play, final consonants were still often omitted, but a few spontaneous accurate productions were noted.\n\n4. Short phrases with mixed targets\n- Used a picture scene to encourage short phrases like “see fish,” “big hat,” “my mom.”\n- Child imitated 2–3-word phrases with moderate support, showing better clarity on practiced target words than on unfamiliar vocabulary.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Progress suggests readiness to continue building phrase-level practice for initial /s/ and /f/ in structured tasks.\n- Plan to further increase opportunities for short carrier phrases and begin to fade some cues when possible.\n- Caregiver encouraged to model slow, clear speech during daily routines and highlight a few practice words (e.g., “sun,” “fish,” “feet”) in simple phrases such as “see sun,” “big fish.”"

Some emerging attempts to add a \"t\" with heavy modeling.\n\n2) Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued focus on \"back sound\" /k/ in front of the mirror.\n- Child produced /k/ in isolation more reliably with maximal cueing (tongue back cue, clinician modeling); still frequent /t/ substitutions.\n- In CV syllables (\"ku,\" \"ka,\" \"ki\"), child imitated /k/ accurately in a small number of trials when paced slowly; accuracy decreased as speed increased.\n\n3) Initial /k/ in simple words (CVC)\n- Introduced a small set of initial /k/ words in imitation (\"car,\" \"cow,\" \"key\").\n- Productions were often approximated (e.g., \"tar\" for \"car\"), but a few clearer \"car\" productions were noted with segmented practice (isolated /k/ + word).\n\n4) Initial /s/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Revisited /s/ as a \"long snake sound\" in isolation.\n- Child produced /s/ independently in isolation a few times after a model; still added a vowel in many attempts (\"suh\").\n- Briefly trialed CV syllables (\"see,\" \"soo\"), with emerging accuracy when given a slow model.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Skills appear similar to baseline overall, with some early signs of increased attempts at endings and /k/.\n- Continue focusing on final consonants in functional CVC words and building more consistent /k/ and /s/ in isolation and syllables.\n- Home practice: Encourage short, play-based practice of CVC words (e.g., during snack with \"cup,\" \"up,\" \"ham\") and model clear final sounds without pressuring child to repeat every time."

With moderate cues, child produced clear final /p/ or /m/ in many attempts; began to carry over some endings with lighter cueing.\n- Final /t/: still more variable but child produced clearer /t/ in several imitation trials (e.g., \"hat,\" \"hot\") with slowed speech and modeling.\n\n2) Initial /k/ in isolation, syllables, and simple words\n- Child imitated /k/ in isolation with improved accuracy; fewer /t/ substitutions when given tongue-back cues.\n- In CV syllables, child produced /k/ more consistently in \"koo\" and \"kah\" combinations.\n- At the word level, child approximated \"car,\" \"key,\" and \"cow\" with clearer initial /k/ in multiple trials when segmented (\"k\" + \"ar\"). Needed continued verbal and visual cues but overall accuracy higher than previous week.\n\n3) Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation and in \"see,\" \"so,\" \"sue\" syllables.\n- Child produced a sustained /s/ sound more independently, with fewer added vowels.\n- In CV syllables, accuracy was emerging; child could imitate \"see\" fairly clearly, while other vowels remained less consistent.\n\n4) Functional CVC words with final consonants\n- Incorporated target sounds into functional words used in play (e.g., \"cup,\" \"up,\" \"map\" during snack/pretend kitchen).\n- Child sometimes produced endings spontaneously after clinician’s model, though not yet consistent.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Moderate, meaningful progress noted in final consonants and initial /k/ at the imitated word level.\n- Next sessions will continue consolidating final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/ at word level, with gradual reduction of cueing.\n- Home practice: Parent encouraged to highlight final sounds in everyday words (e.g., \"cup,\" \"hat\") and to praise any self-corrections."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\n- Caregiver shared that they are most concerned about child's speech clarity, especially with new listeners. Noted that child often leaves off sounds at the ends of words and sometimes \"mushes\" words together. No major changes since initial evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned with some hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance. Once in the room, child was curious and engaged with toys. Attention to adult-directed tasks was variable; needed frequent reminders to \"listen\" and return to table tasks but responded well to short, play-based activities.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Targeted early consonants /m, b, p/ in simple syllables (e.g., \"ma,\" \"bee,\" \"boo,\" \"mama,\" \"baby\"). Child imitated CV shapes fairly consistently, though productions were sometimes quiet or slightly distorted. CVCV forms were more effortful; child tended to reduce to one syllable (e.g., \"mama\" → \"ma\"). Moderate verbal models and visual cues were needed.\n\n2. Final consonant production (CVC words)\n- Introduced final /p, t, m/ at imitated word level (e.g., \"cup,\" \"cat,\" \"ham\"). Child frequently omitted final sounds or added a schwa (\"cup\" → \"cuh\"). With direct modeling and visual cues (tapping for end sound), child produced a few clearer final consonants, but accuracy remained low and inconsistent.\n\n3. Initial /k/ in isolation and syllables\n- Practiced back-of-the-tongue sound /k/ in isolation using mirror and tongue-back cues. Child could approximate /k/ in isolation intermittently but often substituted /t/. In CV syllables (\"koo,\" \"kee\"), substitutions persisted. Tactile and verbal prompts were required for most trials.\n\n4. Early phrase production for clarity (2–3 word combinations)\n- In play, child used many 2–3 word phrases, but several words within the phrase were not clearly articulated. SLP modeled slower, slightly exaggerated productions (e.g., \"big ball,\" \"my car\"). Child occasionally imitated clearer versions with direct imitation but did not yet carry this over independently.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on establishing consistent final consonants and more accurate /k/ in isolation and simple syllables. Maintain practice of CV and CVCV syllable shapes with early consonants.\n- Caregiver encouraged to model slow, clear speech at home and emphasize end sounds in a natural way (e.g., gently highlighting the last sound in words like \"cup\" and \"hat\").\n- Plan to reassess response to /k/ cues next session and consider introducing a small set of familiar CVC words if accuracy in isolation improves."

Noticed a few clearer words this week (\"cup,\" \"mommy\") when they reminded child to \"say it slowly.\" No other changes.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated easily and was eager to show toys from the waiting room. Participation was generally good with brief periods of silliness. Responded well to visual schedules and short movement breaks.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Continued work on CV and CVCV sequences with /m, b, p, t, d/. Child showed slightly better consistency with CVCV (\"mama,\" \"baby,\" \"puppy\"), producing both syllables more often rather than reducing to one. Still required direct modeling, but fewer repetitions were needed for an accurate attempt.\n\n2. Final consonant production (CVC words)\n- Revisited final /p, t, m/ in simple CVC words. Child demonstrated more frequent attempts to close words (e.g., \"cup\" with a soft final /p/). Accuracy remained emerging, but there were more recognizable final consonants compared to last session. Visual cue of \"tapping\" the end sound was helpful.\n\n3. Initial /k/ in isolation and syllables\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation, then in CV syllables. Child produced a clearer /k/ sound in isolation several times with tongue-back cues and mirror. In syllables (\"koo,\" \"key\"), still often substituted /t/, but there were a few accurate productions with immediate imitation.\n\n4. 2–3 word phrases with clearer key words\n- In play, focused on 2–3 word phrases that highlighted target words (e.g., \"my cup,\" \"big cat\"). Child imitated clearer versions with support and occasionally initiated slightly clearer productions when prompted to \"say it slowly.\" Intelligibility was still reduced, but there were more noticeable attempts to correct when SLP modeled.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue current targets; child is showing small but positive changes, particularly with attempts at final consonants and /k/ in isolation.\n- Encourage caregiver to continue using slow, clear models and gentle reminders (\"use your end sound\") during everyday routines.\n- Next session, consider introducing a small core set of CVC words for repetitive practice if progress with final consonants continues."

Noted that child sometimes tries again if they are not understood, which is new. No concerns regarding hearing or health.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned smoothly and appeared comfortable in the therapy room. Maintained attention to structured games for slightly longer intervals than previous sessions. Accepted cues and corrections without frustration.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Practiced a small set of CVC words (\"cup,\" \"cap,\" \"cat,\" \"hat,\" \"ham,\" \"mom\"). Compared to last session, child showed increased consistency in attempting and sometimes marking final consonants. With visual tap and slow models, several words were produced with clearly audible end sounds. Accuracy is still not fully consistent but is clearly improving.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued drills for /k/ using mirror, tongue-back cues, and \"cough\" trick. Child produced /k/ in isolation with moderate success, then moved into CV syllables (\"koo,\" \"kee,\" \"kah\"). There was a slight increase in accurate /k/ productions in syllables compared to last week, though substitutions to /t/ are still common. Child sometimes self-corrected after hearing SLP's model.\n\n3. Syllable shapes (CVCV, alternating)\n- Targeted alternating CVCV sequences (e.g., \"bunny,\" \"teddy,\" \"kitty\"). Child was more successful marking both syllables and less likely to reduce to single syllables. Some consonants and vowels were still distorted, but rhythm and syllable count were more accurate.\n\n4. Short phrases with target words\n- Used simple play-based routines (feeding animals, cars, etc.) to elicit short phrases such as \"my cat,\" \"big cup,\" \"mom ham.\" When provided a clear model and cue to \"say all your sounds,\" child imitated phrases with improving clarity on target words, particularly those practiced as CVC.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on final consonants and /k/ in CV syllables; child is showing emerging improvement and benefits from consistent visual and verbal cueing.\n- Encourage caregiver to practice a small set of CVC words at home (e.g., \"cup,\" \"cat,\" \"hat,\" \"mom\") using slow, emphasized end sounds.\n- Plan to introduce a few early /k/ words (e.g., \"car,\" \"cow\") in imitation next session if /k/ in syllables remains stable."

Also reported a new word \"car\" that sounded clearer this week. Intelligibility with close family is \"a bit better\" per caregiver.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered room independently and was enthusiastic about familiar routines. Demonstrated better sustained attention to table-top tasks and responded well to simple visual timer cues. Cooperative with cues and enjoyed turn-taking games.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Continued work with a set of CVC words. Child showed a noticeable increase in consistent final consonant marking with verbal model plus visual tap. Several words (\"cup,\" \"hat,\" \"mom\") were produced with clearly audible final sounds in most trials. Less need for repeated modeling; child sometimes corrected when SLP highlighted the missing end sound.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at syllable and word level\n- Practiced /k/ in CV syllables and introduced a few simple words (\"car,\" \"cow,\" \"key\") in imitation. Child produced /k/ in syllables with improved accuracy and was able to imitate /k/ in initial position in several words with moderate cueing. There were still occasional /t/ substitutions, but overall consistency and ease of production improved from previous sessions.\n\n3. CVCV and multisyllabic practice\n- Used play themes to practice 2-syllable words (\"bunny,\" \"baby,\" \"teddy\") and a few early 3-syllable words (\"banana\" with support). Child more reliably produced both syllables, and caregiver was shown how to tap or clap for each part. Consonant accuracy was variable but syllable marking was stronger.\n\n4. Short phrases with target CVC words\n- Built short phrases around target CVC and /k/ words (e.g., \"my car,\" \"big cup,\" \"hat on\"). In imitation, child produced phrases with improved clarity on the key word and slightly better pacing. Some spontaneous attempts at similar phrases were heard in play, though not yet consistently clear.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Given the moderate gains, continue to expand CVC word list and practice initial /k/ at word level in structured play.\n- Encourage caregiver to incorporate target words into daily routines (e.g., \"cup\" at snack, \"hat\" when going outside, \"car\" during play), modeling clear end sounds and initial /k/.\n- Next session, consider probing simple carrier phrases (\"I see ___\") with familiar CVC words if accuracy remains steady."

Overall engagement remained good, with brief periods of distraction that responded to redirection. Child appeared proud when praised for clear words.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC: /p, t, m/ and a few /k/)\n- Continued practice with familiar CVC words and introduced a few with final /k/ (e.g., \"back,\" \"book\" in imitation). Child maintained improved consistency for final /p, t, m/ from last session. Final /k/ was more challenging and often reduced or changed, though child attempted to mark an ending when cued.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word level\n- Practiced initial /k/ in words like \"car,\" \"cow,\" \"key,\" and \"cup\" using visual and verbal cues. Child continued to produce /k/ with moderate success in imitation, similar to last session, but needed ongoing reminders to \"use the back sound.\" Some self-corrections were observed after SLP modeled.\n\n3. CVCV and early multisyllabic words\n- Targeted 2-syllable words (\"bunny,\" \"baby,\" \"kitty\") in play. Child reliably produced two syllables with support. Accuracy for individual consonants remained mixed but generally stable compared to last session.\n\n4. Short phrases with target words\n- Practiced short phrases (\"my car,\" \"more cup,\" \"big hat\") in structured play. Child imitated phrases with reasonable clarity on the key words when given a direct model. Independent phrases were less clear but similar to previous session.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Skills appear to be consolidating at the current level. Continue reinforcing final consonants, especially adding in a few final /k/ words, and maintain practice of initial /k/ in words.\n- Caregiver encouraged to keep using the tapping strategy for end sounds and to model back-of-the-tongue /k/ (e.g., exaggerating \"car,\" \"cookie\").\n- Next session, plan to recheck consistency and consider gentle expansion of /k/ word list if performance remains steady."

With visual and verbal models, child imitated these phrases at a level consistent with last session. Spontaneous use of longer phrases occurred occasionally in play but remained less clear.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Current note reflects continued consolidation at this level. Maintain practice of final consonants and initial /k\" within short phrases and simple sentences.\n- Encourage caregiver to continue providing frequent, low-pressure opportunities for child to use practiced words and phrases at home.\n- Plan to review overall progress at next session and discuss future therapy focus and home programming with caregiver."

No significant new changes this week.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child was comfortable and engaged throughout the session. Participation in both structured and play-based tasks remained steady. Tolerated repetition well and seemed to enjoy demonstrating \"good talking\" for caregiver at the end of session.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC: /p, t, m, k/)\n- Reviewed CVC words with final /p, t, m, k\" across a mix of picture naming and play. Child continued to produce final /p, t, m\" accurately in most contexts and showed generally consistent marking of final /k\" in familiar words, with occasional omissions. Performance remains stable at this improved level.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word and phrase level\n- Practiced initial /k\" in words and short phrases (\"my car,\" \"cookie please,\" \"key in box\"). Child maintained good accuracy in imitation with light cueing. Occasional /t\" substitutions were heard when child was more excited or speaking quickly, but overall pattern similar to previous weeks.\n\n3. Multisyllabic words (2–3 syllables)\n- Continued work on 2- and 3-syllable words (\"bunny,\" \"tiger,\" \"banana,\" \"pumpkin\"). Child reliably produced correct syllable number with supports and produced several intelligible approximations. No major shift in accuracy compared to prior sessions.\n\n4. Carrier phrases and short sentences\n- Used familiar sentence frames (\"I see a ___,\" \"I want more ___\") with target words. With visual prompts and models, child imitated 3–4 word utterances consistently and produced some similar phrases spontaneously in play. Intelligibility of these practiced phrases remained comparable to previous weeks.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Skills appear stable at the current level, with maintained gains in final consonant use and initial /k\" productions. Continued therapy would focus on increasing independence, expanding to less familiar words, and supporting carryover into more spontaneous conversation.\n- Caregiver encouraged to keep using clear models, simple carrier phrases, and praise for self-corrections at home.\n- Recommend ongoing monitoring of generalization in natural settings and collaboration with preschool staff (if applicable) to support speech clarity across environments."

            "note_text": "Parent/caregiver report:\n- Mother reported that speech is \"still pretty hard to understand\" for unfamiliar listeners. She notices he leaves off sounds at the ends of words and often says \"doo\" for \"shoe\" and \"tup\" for \"cup.\" No major changes since initial evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- 4-year-old boy transitioned with mild hesitation but separated from mother with reassurance. Once in the room, he engaged well with cars and animal toys. Attention span was fair; he required occasional redirection back to tasks but responded to visual schedules and turn-taking games.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /k/ at syllable and word level\n- Baseline probing completed. In isolation, he could approximate /k/ in 4/10 attempts with maximal verbal and visual cues (\"tongue in the back\" and mirror). In simple CV syllables (\"ku, ki, ko\"), accuracy decreased (2–3/10), with frequent fronting to /t/ (e.g., \"too\" for \"coo\"). At the word level (\"car, key, cow\"), he produced mostly /t/ substitutions in imitation. Requires direct modeling plus tactile cue on throat.\n\n2. Final consonant production (p, t, m) in CVC words\n- Probed final consonant production in imitation using picture cards (\"cup, cat, home, map, boat\"). Frequently omitted final consonants, producing open syllables (\"cu\" for \"cup,\" \"ca\" for \"cat\"). With simultaneous production and exaggerated clinician model, he marked the final sound in ~2/10 trials across sounds. Greater success with final /m/ in \"home\" and \"ham\" when whispered first.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Attempted /s/ in isolation with visual cue (smile, teeth together, long airflow). He produced a mix of /d/ and /th/ substitutions, with occasional brief /s/-like frication when directly shaping from a long /t/ (\"tssss\"). Able to sustain an approximated /s/ in isolation in 3/10 attempts with maximal verbal and gestural cues. Not yet consistent in CV syllables.\n\n4. Functional communication / spontaneous language sample\n- During play, produced mainly 2–3-word phrases (\"my car,\" \"I want that,\" \"no mine\"). Intelligibility reduced at the sentence level due to sound errors and omissions. Able to repair breakdowns occasionally when prompted (\"tell me again\").\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to establish accurate /k/ in isolation and simple syllables before expanding to more word practice.\n- Continue targeting final consonants (p, t, m) in high-interest words using simultaneous production and tactile cues.\n- Introduce parent to \"whisper the last sound\" strategy for final consonants during book reading.\n- Provide caregiver with a short list of practice words for /k/ and final /m/ at the imitation level."

She notices he sometimes says \"tar\" for \"car\" but is \"trying hard.\" No concerns with hearing or health this week.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Arrived cheerful and eager to show therapist his toy truck. Transitioned smoothly into the therapy room. Maintained attention well for table-top games when they were brief and alternated with movement activities. Responded well to praise and sticker rewards.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Marked improvement compared to last session. In isolation, he produced /k/ with clearer back placement in approximately 7/10 trials with moderate cues (mirror, \"cough\" trick). In CV syllables (\"ku, ki, ko\"), accuracy increased to about 6/10 in imitation; remaining attempts showed fronting to /t/. Able to self-correct occasionally when given a reminder to \"use your back sound.\"\n\n2. Initial /k/ in simple words (car, key, cow, cookie)\n- Introduced imitated word level. With a direct model and visual cue, he produced initial /k/ accurately in ~5/10 trials. Best accuracy with \"car\" and \"cow,\" more difficulty with \"cookie.\" Errors were primarily /t/ substitutions. Needed moderate verbal cueing and slowed rate.\n\n3. Final consonant production (p, t, m) in CVC words\n- Continued work at imitation level with picture cards and a tap-on-the-table cue for the \"last sound.\" Accuracy increased modestly: he marked final consonants in about 4/10 opportunities across sounds, with more consistent final /m/ (\"ham,\" \"home\") than /p/ or /t/. Often added a short schwa after the consonant (\"cup-uh\").\n\n4. Initial /s/ in isolation\n- Practiced /s/ in front of the mirror using a \"snake sound\" visual. Able to hold an approximated /s/ for 4–5 seconds in about half of trials with significant clinician support. Still frequently shifts to /th/ or a stopped /t/ without cues.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to build consistency for /k/ in syllables and high-frequency words; maintain at the imitated word level next session.\n- Maintain focus on final /m/ and /p/ using tapping cues and whispering the last sound.\n- Encourage caregiver to practice 5–6 /k/ words daily (car, cow, key, cookie) using clear, slow models and praise for close approximations.\n- Continue shaping /s/ in isolation before advancing to syllables."

She notes that he will sometimes correct himself (\"tar... car!\"). She has not yet noticed changes in final sounds but feels he is \"more chatty\" overall.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Entered session with good energy and quickly engaged with a farm play set. Demonstrated good turn-taking and followed simple directions. Required occasional breaks for movement but returned to tasks with minimal prompting.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /k/ at imitated word level and emerging carrier phrases\n- At the imitated word level (\"car, key, cow, cookie, kite\"), he produced initial /k/ accurately in approximately 8/10 trials with light verbal cues (\"back sound\"). Fronting to /t/ occurred less frequently and he independently attempted to fix it 3–4 times after hearing his own error. Briefly introduced simple carrier phrase \"my ___\" with /k/ words; he successfully produced /k/ in 4/8 phrase attempts with moderate cueing.\n\n2. Final consonant production (p, t, m) in CVC words\n- Continued at imitation level using game-based activities. Accuracy showed slight improvement: final consonants were present in about 5/10 opportunities. Final /m/ remained strongest (\"home,\" \"gum\"), followed by /p/ (\"cup\"). Final /t/ still often omitted. He responded well to visual cueing (touching picture when saying the last sound).\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation, then in simple CV sequences (\"see, soo\"). In isolation, he produced a recognizable /s/ in ~6/10 attempts with moderate verbal and visual cues. In syllables, accuracy dropped slightly (about 4/10) with frequent /th/ substitutions. Able to imitate a longer /ts\" blend as a stepping stone in a few trials.\n\n4. Functional communication / intelligibility in play\n- During play-based routines, used 3–4-word utterances (\"I want more cars,\" \"put it in there\"). Intelligibility to clinician improved when familiar with context, though sound errors remained evident. Showed increased willingness to repeat when asked and accepted feedback positively.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen /k/ at the imitated word level and expand into simple carrier phrases with support.\n- Maintain work on final /p, m/ in a limited set of functional words; consider introducing simple visual cue card for \"last sound.\"\n- Continue shaping /s\" from \"t\" and practice in high-interest syllables (\"see, soup\").\n- Encourage caregiver to model and praise self-corrections (\"you fixed it to car—nice back sound!\")."

She still finds it hard to hear final sounds, but she feels \"some words are clearer.\" No new concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Transitioned smoothly and checked the visual schedule independently. Participated well in structured games and was able to stay with table-top tasks for slightly longer intervals. Needed gentle reminders to speak slowly when excited.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /k/ at word and carrier phrase level\n- At the imitated word level, he produced initial /k/ with good accuracy (~9/10 trials) using only occasional verbal reminders. Began to practice short carrier phrases (\"my car,\" \"big cookie,\" \"go cow\") in structured play. In these phrases, initial /k/ remained accurate in approximately 7/10 attempts, with breakdowns occurring when he spoke quickly. Demonstrated a few spontaneous /k/ words in play (\"car go,\" \"cow there\") without prompts.\n\n2. Final consonant production (p, t, m) in CVC words\n- Continued at the imitated word level. Final /m/ was present in most trials (about 7/10) for target words (\"home, gum, ham\"). Final /p/ accuracy increased modestly to ~6/10 with tapping cue; he still occasionally produced \"cu\" for \"cup.\" Final /t/ remained the most challenging, with frequent omissions or substitutions (\"ca\" for \"cat\").\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- In isolation, he produced a clear /s/ in roughly 7/10 attempts with a visual snake cue, needing less physical prompting. In CV syllables (\"see, soo, sah\"), accuracy hovered around 5/10. Some productions were distorted but moving closer to target. He tolerated repeated practice and enjoyed the \"snake sound\" game.\n\n4. Early generalization / self-monitoring\n- When presented with picture choices, he occasionally commented on his own speech (\"I did back sound\") after producing /k/. Needed adult support to identify when final sounds were missing.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue /k/ in carrier phrases and begin to probe for spontaneous use in more natural play.\n- Maintain focus on final /p, m/ and begin to isolate a small set of final /t/ words for intensive practice.\n- Continue building stability of /s/ in syllables before moving to word level.\n- Encourage caregiver to practice short phrases with /k/ (\"my car,\" \"big cookie\") during daily routines and to gently emphasize final sounds in a few chosen words."

No changes in health or routine.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Arrived in good spirits and quickly engaged with a board game. Demonstrated improved ability to follow multi-step directions within activities. Occasionally rushed through words when excited, but accepted cues to \"use slow talking.\"\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /k/ in carrier phrases and emerging short sentences\n- In structured play, he produced /k/ accurately in carrier phrases (\"my car,\" \"go cow,\" \"big cookie\") in approximately 9/10 imitated opportunities with minimal cueing. Began to use short 3–4-word sentences (\"my car go fast\") in imitation; /k/ remained mostly accurate within these contexts (~7/10). Several spontaneous uses of /k/ words (\"car,\" \"cow,\" \"cookie\") observed without prompting.\n\n2. Final consonant production (p, t, m) in CVC words\n- Continued practice at the imitated word level using picture matching and a \"tap the last sound\" strategy. Final /m/ remained strong (~8/10) and final /p/ showed gradual improvement (~7/10). Final /t/ continued to be inconsistent (approximately 4/10), with frequent omissions. He responded well when final /t/ was highlighted in a whisper (\"caT\").\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Produced /s/ in isolation with good consistency (~8/10) using only a light visual cue. In CV syllables, accuracy increased slightly to about 6/10. Some productions had minor distortions but were clearly different from /t/ or /th/. He enjoyed taking turns being the \"snake\" and giving the clinician feedback.\n\n4. Functional communication / intelligibility\n- During free play, used 3–5-word phrases to comment and request (\"I want more cars,\" \"put it in there,\" \"look my car\"). Intelligibility to clinician was fair, with clearer /k/ helping in familiar words. Final consonant omissions and /s/ distortions still impacted overall clarity.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue strengthening /k/ in short sentences and monitor spontaneous use across activities.\n- Maintain targeted practice of final /p, m/ and continue focused work on a small set of final /t/ words (e.g., cat, hat, boat).\n- Prepare to introduce /s/ at the imitated word level in the next 1–2 sessions if syllable-level accuracy remains steady.\n- Encourage caregiver to praise clear /k/ and final consonants, and to model slow, clear speech during daily routines."

Stayed engaged in structured tasks for most of the session with minimal redirection. Some mild silliness when he became tired near the end, but he remained cooperative.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /k/ in short sentences and spontaneous play\n- In imitation, he produced /k/ accurately in 3–5-word sentences (\"my car goes fast,\" \"I see a cow\") in about 8–9/10 opportunities with minimal verbal cues. During unstructured play, several spontaneous /k/ productions were observed (\"car go,\" \"cow there,\" \"cookie please\") with good accuracy. Occasional fronting to /t/ occurred when speaking quickly, but he often accepted a prompt to repeat using his \"back sound.\"\n\n2.

Participation was good; he followed routines and accepted therapist-selected activities. Needed a few prompts to slow down his speech when excited.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /k/ in sentences and conversation\n- At the sentence level in imitation (3–5 words), /k/ remained accurate in approximately 9/10 opportunities with minimal cues. In structured conversation about pictures, he used /k/ correctly in familiar words (\"car, cookie, cow\") most of the time. Occasional fronting persisted in longer or less familiar words but did not significantly impact his ability to participate.\n\n2. Final consonant production (p, t, m) in CVC words\n- Continued focus at the imitated word level with game-based tasks. Accuracy for final /m/ and /p/ remained similar to last week (~8/10 and ~7/10 respectively) with supports.

Isolation accuracy around 8/10 with minimal cueing; syllable-level around 6/10 with some persistent distortions. He continued to enjoy \"snake sound\" activities but required similar levels of support as previous weeks.\n\n4. Functional communication\n- Used multi-word sentences and basic story-telling about preschool. Intelligibility improved for topics with familiar vocabulary but remained reduced overall due to ongoing phonological patterns.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to monitor /k/ in conversation but shift primary treatment focus toward final consonants and /s/ as /k/ is nearing generalization.\n- Maintain targeted practice for final /p, t, m\" and consider adding simple visual cues for final /t/ (e.g., drawing a dot for the last sound).\n- Continue /s/ syllable practice; re-assess readiness for word-level targets in upcoming sessions.\n- Encourage caregiver to focus on a few \"power words\" at home for final consonants and to keep practices positive and brief."

She has been working on words like \"cat\" and \"cup\" at home and feels he can do them when they practice slowly, but he \"forgets\" in regular talking.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Entered willingly and checked in with the clinician verbally. Participated well in both table-top and play-based tasks. Needed occasional prompts to stay seated during structured activities.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /k/ in conversation\n- /k/ remained consistently accurate in conversation across familiar topics. Only rare fronting errors occurred, and he typically accepted prompts to repeat. This skill appears stable at the conversational level.\n\n2. Final consonant production (p, t, m) in CVC words and short phrases\n- Accuracy remained similar to last several sessions. In imitation, final /m/ ~8/10, final /p/ ~7/10, final /t/ ~5/10 with visual and tactile cues. In short phrases, he continued to mark final /m/ and /p/ in roughly half of attempts and tended to omit final /t/. No notable change in independence or generalization.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- /s/ production continued at a similar level: isolation ~8/10, CV syllables ~6/10 with mild distortions. He was able to adjust slightly with reminders to keep his tongue behind his teeth but still needed consistent cueing.\n\n4. Functional communication\n- Used complex sentences and expanded comments during play. Intelligibility to the clinician was fair to good in context; unfamiliar listeners would likely still need repetition and context support.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Maintain monitoring of /k/ while focusing direct treatment time on final consonants and /s/.\n- Continue practice with a limited set of high-value final /p, t, m\" words and phrases, emphasizing slow rate and tapping cues.\n- Continue /s/ syllable work; consider trialing a small number of simple /s/ words in imitation to probe readiness, while recognizing that syllable-level stability is still developing.\n- Encourage caregiver to keep home practice short and consistent, praising effort and approximations rather than only perfect productions."

She noted he often leaves off the last sound in words (e.g., “ca” for “cat”) and sometimes says “tup” for “cup.” No major changes since the initial evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned into the therapy room with minimal hesitation, holding mom’s hand. He engaged well with toys and responded positively to praise and visual supports. Attention was best in short, play-based activities (3–4 minutes) with frequent changes in materials.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonant production (p, t, k) in CVC words – imitation level\n- Targeted words such as “cup, cap, cat, hat, hot, hop, back, bike.”\n- With simultaneous production and maximal verbal/visual cueing (e.g., “say it with your quiet stop sound at the end”), client produced final consonants accurately in some trials but frequently omitted or neutralized them (e.g., “cu” for “cup”).\n- Accuracy was inconsistent and strongly cue-dependent; he did not yet carry over to independent productions.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and simple syllables (CV)\n- Practiced “k” in isolation using “tongue back” cues and a mirror.\n- Able to imitate /k/ in isolation intermittently but often substituted /t/ despite cues.\n- In CV syllables (e.g., “koo, kah”), production was mostly fronted to /t/; successful productions occurred only with slow pacing and maximal verbal models.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation\n- Introduced “long, quiet snake sound” /s/ in isolation.\n- Client could approximate a prolonged /s/ with strong visual models; intermittent nasal emission and stopping observed.\n- Not yet ready to move to syllables; focus remained on establishing a consistent airflow and tongue placement.\n\n4. Functional phrases for requesting\n- During play, modeled short, functional phrases (e.g., “more cars,” “my turn”).\n- Client primarily used single words or gestures to request; imitated some two-word combinations with direct models.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to establish final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/ at the isolation and simple word level with heavy support.\n- Encourage parents to model clear final sounds in daily routines (e.g., emphasizing end sounds in simple words like “up, out, in, hot”) without pressuring him to repeat.\n- Next session: maintain current targets; consider adding simple minimal pairs (e.g., “key/tea”) if /k/ in isolation stabilizes."

He was playful and cooperative, though he needed frequent redirection from self-directed play back to speech tasks. Responded well to turn-taking games and visual token reinforcement.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonant production (p, t, k) in CVC words – imitation level\n- Practiced “cup, cap, cat, coat, bike, back, eat, out.”\n- Compared to last week, he produced more audible final /p/ and /t/ when given a clear model and verbal cue (e.g., “stop your sound at the end”).\n- Still inconsistent, but showed a slight increase in attempts to add the end sound, even when not fully accurate.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CV and CVC words – imitation\n- Continued with tongue-back cues and mirror.\n- Client produced /k/ in isolation more consistently, though still not yet automatic.\n- At the word level (e.g., “key, car, cat”), he continued to substitute /t/ frequently, but there were a few clear /k/ productions with maximal cueing. Emerging improvement noted, but still at the imitated word level.\n\n3. Initial /s/ isolation and CV syllables\n- Revisited /s/ as a “long, quiet snake sound.”\n- Able to hold /s/ for several seconds with visual cue to keep tongue behind teeth.\n- Introduced simple syllables (“see, soo”); accuracy was variable, with some productions distorted or stopped, but overall more consistent than at baseline.\n\n4. Two-word functional phrases in play\n- Modeled and elicited two-word requests (e.g., “more bubbles,” “big car”).\n- Client imitated several two-word phrases and independently produced a few (e.g., “my car,” “more please”) with light cueing.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/ at the word and syllable levels, emphasizing accuracy with strong models.\n- Encourage caregivers to continue modeling end sounds and to praise any attempts where he adds a final sound, even if not perfect.\n- Next session: consider beginning simple minimal pairs for final consonants (e.g., “bee/beep”) to heighten his awareness if consistency continues to improve."

Final consonants (p, t, k) in sentences and conversation\n- Practiced short sentences and then observed carryover in play (e.g., “I like soup,” “Put it back on top,” “I see a cat”).\n- Final consonants were present in many structured sentences; some omissions continued in more spontaneous, rapid speech.\n- Performance was comparable to last week, with ongoing responsiveness to cues to “use your end sound.”\n\n2. Initial /k/ in sentences and narrative tasks\n- Used simple picture sequences and story retell tasks including /k/ words.\n- /k/ remained accurate in most positions with minimal cueing; occasional errors were noted only in more complex or less familiar sentences.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in sentences\n- Revisited sentences such as “The sun is hot,” “I see soap,” “The soup is hot,” “Sit on the seat,” and added a few new ones.\n- Accuracy was similar to previous sessions: he produced initial /s/ clearly in many trials with light cueing, with some distortions or omissions when attention waned.\n\n4. /s/ blends – imitated word level\n- Continued practice with “stop, star, spoon, spider, spot, spill.”\n- Blends remained inconsistent; he often simplified them but was able to produce some accurate /st/ words with slow, segmented models.\n- No significant change from last week, but he remained motivated and willing to attempt the targets.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue working at the sentence level for final consonants and /s/ to support stability before increasing complexity further.\n- Maintain focused practice on /s/ blends at the word level; not yet ready to move to phrases.\n- Parents encouraged to keep modeling clear blends (e.g., “stop, spill”) during daily activities and to praise attempts rather than focusing on errors."

Still needed frequent models and reminders to slow down.\n\nGoal 3: Marking final consonants in CVC words (imitation)\n- Targeted high-interest CVC words (e.g., “cup, map, hat”) in a picture game.\n- Continued to omit many final consonants independently.\n- With simultaneous production and emphasis on the end sound, he was able to mark final consonants more often than last session, but accuracy remained inconsistent.\n\nGoal 4: Functional phrases in play\n- Modeled short carrier phrases (e.g., “my ___,” “I want ___”) and encouraged imitation.\n- He readily imitated many phrases; speech remained reduced in clarity but willingness to attempt longer utterances was strong.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on /s/ and /f/ in isolation and syllables, gradually reducing cueing where possible.\n- Maintain work on final consonant marking with a small core set of CVC words.\n- Encourage parent to integrate quick “sound practice” into daily routines (e.g., brushing teeth, bath time) with 5–10 repetitions of /s/ and /f/.\n- Anticipate trialing initial /s/ and /f/ at word level next session if current gains are maintained."

She reports that he is talking in short sentences at home but often leaves off the ends of words. No recent changes in health or hearing.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client transitioned to the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from mother with encouragement. Once engaged in play, he was cheerful and cooperative. Attention to adult-directed tasks was fair; needed occasional redirection from self-directed play back to speech tasks.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words (p, t, m)\n- Targeted final /p, t, m/ in simple words (e.g., pop, hat, mom) at the imitated word level. Client frequently omitted the final consonant or added a neutral vowel (\"pah\" for \"pop\"). With maximal verbal models and visual cues (tapping for the last sound, hand-to-mouth cue), he produced clearer final consonants in a small number of trials, but accuracy was inconsistent and required significant support.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in single words\n- Introduced initial /s/ in isolation and at the imitated word level (sun, soup, sock). In isolation, he approximated /s/ with a more /sh/ or /th/-like sound. At the word level, /s/ was often substituted or omitted. Required frequent cueing to keep tongue behind teeth and to use a “quiet snake sound.” Limited success with independent productions.\n\n3. Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Observed and elicited a range of syllable shapes in play (e.g., \"mama,\" \"baba,\" \"tata\" for car sounds). CV and reduplicated CVCV forms were easier. When cued to attempt alternating CVCV (e.g., \"bunny,\" \"tiger\"), he tended to reduce them to shorter forms (\"bu,\" \"tie\").\n\n4. Functional phrases for requesting\n- During play, modeled simple 2–3 word phrases (\"my turn,\" \"more cars,\" \"open please\"). Client mostly used single words or jargon. He imitated short phrases in a few opportunities when given a direct model and enthusiastic reinforcement.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to target final consonants at the imitated word level with heavy visual and verbal cueing.\n- Maintain focus on initial /s/ in isolation and simple words; consider adding tactile cues as tolerated.\n- Encourage parents to model clear final sounds in everyday words (e.g., \"up,\" \"cup,\" \"bed\") without pressuring him to repeat.\n- Next session: re-check final consonants and initial /s/; consider introducing simple /s/-blend perception activities if appropriate."

She notices he is trying to say longer sentences but they \"come out a bit mushy.\" Family has started emphasizing final sounds as discussed but is unsure if he is picking it up yet.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client entered the room more easily this week and appeared comfortable with the clinician. He engaged readily in toy-based activities and followed simple routines with visual supports. Attention was good for short, structured activities; brief breaks were helpful between tasks.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words (p, t, m)\n- Revisited final /p, t, m/ in imitated CVC words (pop, hat, mom, map, mat). Compared to last session, he produced the final consonant more frequently when provided with a slow model and visual cue (tapping the table for the last sound). Continued to add a slight vowel after some consonants but showed more attempts to “stop” his voice at the end of the word. Accuracy remained variable but there were more clear, successful productions.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in isolation and single words\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation using a mirror and “snake sound” imagery. Client was able to approximate a more consistent /s/ when focusing on teeth together and airflow. At the imitated word level (sun, soup, sock, sand), he still showed frequent substitutions and omissions, but there were a few clearer /s/ productions with direct modeling and repeated practice.\n\n3. Syllable shapes (CVCV alternating)\n- Targeted alternating CVCV forms (e.g., \"bunny,\" \"tiger,\" \"happy\") in imitation. He continued to reduce many to CV or CVC forms (\"bu,\" \"happi\" without final vowel). With segmented modeling (clapping each part), he began to mark more of the syllables, though individual sounds within syllables were often imprecise.\n\n4. Functional 2–3 word phrases\n- Modeled and elicited simple phrases for requesting and commenting (\"more bubbles,\" \"my car,\" \"go fast\"). Client imitated several 2-word combinations when given a clear model and immediate access to a preferred item. Spontaneous phrases were mostly single words, but he showed increased willingness to repeat longer phrases.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue with final consonant practice at the imitated CVC level, reinforcing any clear final sound.\n- Maintain focus on /s/ in isolation and a small set of high-frequency /s/ words.\n- Encourage caregivers to use short, clear 2–3 word models during play (e.g., \"big ball,\" \"more blocks\").\n- Next session: consider beginning simple minimal pair activities for final consonants if consistency continues to improve."

She reports a few clearer words at home, especially with /p/ at the end (\"up,\" \"cup\"). She has not yet noticed changes with /s/.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client was eager to come into the room and quickly engaged with the toys offered. Participation in structured tasks was stronger today; he responded well to visual schedules and brief, game-like drills. Minimal redirection was needed.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words (p, t, m)\n- Targeted final /p, t, m/ using picture cards and a simple game. Accuracy in imitated CVC words was noticeably improved compared to previous sessions. He produced a clear final consonant in many trials when given a model and light verbal reminders (\"don’t forget the last sound\"). Able to contrast pairs such as \"bee\" vs. \"beep\" with increasing awareness. Occasional neutral vowel addition persisted but was less frequent.\n\n2. Final consonant minimal pairs (presence vs. omission)\n- Introduced basic auditory discrimination for final consonants (e.g., \"bow\" vs. \"boat\"). Client was generally able to point to the picture that matched the clinician’s production, suggesting emerging awareness of the difference. When attempting to produce the pairs himself, he was more successful with /p/ and /m/ than /t/.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple words\n- Continued work on /s/ in isolation and a small set of words (sun, soup, sock, sad). With mirror support, he produced a clearer /s/ sound in isolation more consistently, though it sometimes drifted toward /sh/. At the word level, accuracy showed small gains with immediate imitation, but he still needed close modeling and verbal cueing for tongue placement.\n\n4. Two- and three-word phrases in play\n- During play-based activities, modeled and elicited short phrases (\"more bubbles please,\" \"I want car,\" \"big truck\"). Client imitated many 2-word phrases and a few 3-word combinations with good effort. Spontaneous phrases remained mostly 1–2 words but were more frequent overall.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Begin to increase complexity for final consonants by incorporating more minimal pair practice while still supporting accuracy at the word level.\n- Continue shaping /s/ in isolation and a limited number of functional /s/ words.\n- Caregiver to keep highlighting final sounds at home and praise any attempts.\n- Next session: consider trialing final consonants in short carrier phrases (\"my ___,\" \"big ___\") if accuracy remains stable."

She notices clearer endings on some words like \"cup\" and \"map\" but says it is not yet consistent.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client arrived in good spirits and transitioned smoothly. He remained engaged across the session with brief, play-based breaks. Occasional silliness emerged during drill tasks but was easily redirected with structured choices and visual supports.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words and minimal pairs\n- Continued practice with final /p, t, m/ in CVC words and simple minimal pairs (e.g., \"bee\"/\"beep,\" \"see\"/\"seat\"). Performance was similar to last week: he produced final consonants correctly in many imitated trials when cued to “tap” the last sound, though some omissions and vowel additions remained. Discrimination of minimal pairs was generally accurate with picture choices.\n\n2. Final consonants in short carrier phrases\n- Trialed final consonants within simple carrier phrases (\"my cup,\" \"big hat\") in imitation. Client was able to maintain the final consonant on some words when the phrase was slowed down and segmented. However, accuracy dropped when phrases were spoken more naturally, and he required frequent reminders.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and limited word set\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation and in a few key words (sun, sock, soup). His ability to approximate /s/ in isolation remained similar to last session, with a need for visual and verbal cues. At the word level, there were some clearer productions but also many substitutions. No major change in independence noted.\n\n4. Two- and three-word phrases\n- Continued to model functional 2–3 word phrases for commenting and requesting (\"more bubbles,\" \"my turn,\" \"go fast\"). Client imitated several phrases accurately. Spontaneous speech during play included frequent 2-word combinations and occasional 3-word utterances, though articulation remained reduced in clarity.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on consolidating final consonants in CVC words and short carrier phrases; aim for greater consistency before increasing complexity.\n- Continue work on /s/ in isolation and a small word set, prioritizing accuracy over quantity.\n- Encourage caregivers to slow their own speech slightly and highlight key words with clear final sounds.\n- Next session: re-evaluate readiness to expand to additional final consonants or phrase contexts depending on stability."

He quickly joined in the planned games and followed simple directions with minimal prompting. Attention span for table-top tasks was slightly improved; he tolerated short drill segments followed by play.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words and short phrases\n- Targeted final /p, t, m/ and introduced a few /n/ and /k/ words in CVC form. At the imitated word level, he demonstrated increased consistency, producing many final consonants accurately with only light verbal cues (\"remember the last sound\"). In simple carrier phrases (\"my cup,\" \"big hat,\" \"mom’s map\"), he was able to maintain some final consonants, though accuracy decreased as phrase length increased. Notably fewer vowel additions at the end of words today.\n\n2. Final consonant minimal pairs\n- Continued work with minimal pairs to highlight presence vs. absence of final consonants (e.g., \"bee\"/\"beep,\" \"see\"/\"seat,\" \"no\"/\"nose\"). Client showed strong listening skills and was quick to identify the word spoken by the clinician. When producing the pairs, he showed emerging ability to contrast them himself, particularly with /p/ and /m/.\n\n3. Initial /s/ at syllable and word level\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation and moved into CV syllables (\"see,\" \"soo\") and a small set of words (sun, soup, sock). Compared to prior sessions, there was a slight increase in accurate /s/ productions when given a clear model and visual cue for tongue placement. He occasionally self-corrected after an inaccurate attempt when reminded of the “snake sound.”\n\n4. Functional 3-word phrases\n- Modeled short 3-word phrases in play (\"I want bubbles,\" \"I see car,\" \"more big blocks\").

Initial /s/ in functional words\n- Continued practice with a limited set of initial /s/ words (sun, sock, soup, sit). Accuracy remained similar to previous sessions. He continued to need explicit cues for tongue placement and airflow, with some successful productions in imitation but limited independent use.\n\n4. Phrases for requesting and commenting\n- Used structured play to elicit 2–3 word phrases. Client produced many imitated phrases and increasing spontaneous combinations (e.g., \"more bubbles,\" \"my turn now\"). Articulation remained reduced but did not limit his willingness to communicate.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain current final consonant goals while gradually increasing opportunities for use in play-based contexts.\n- Continue focused work on a small set of /s/ words; consider adding simple listening games to support /s/ perception.\n- Encourage caregiver to provide specific praise for clear words (\"I heard your last sound in 'cup'!\").\n- Next session: continue monitoring for any natural increases in phrase-level accuracy for final consonants."

She still hears nice clear words at times, especially when he slows down, but overall intelligibility remains variable.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client separated smoothly and participated well. He was engaged in both drill and play-based tasks, though he occasionally tried to rush through repetitions. Visual schedules and turn-taking games helped maintain focus.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words, phrases, and emerging sentences\n- Continued work on final /p, t, m, n, k/ at the word and short phrase level. Accuracy remained stable compared to previous sessions, with many correct productions when cued and more variability in longer phrases. Briefly introduced very short sentences (e.g., \"I see cup,\" \"I want map\") in imitation; he could sometimes maintain the final consonant when the sentence was segmented and slowed.\n\n2. Final consonants in play-based conversation\n- Embedded final consonant targets into play (e.g., describing what the cars or animals were doing). He produced some accurate final consonants on familiar words when cued but continued to omit them frequently in more spontaneous speech. Awareness appeared to be improving as he accepted feedback and reattempted words.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases\n- Practiced initial /s/ in a small word set and short phrases (\"sock on,\" \"sit down\"). Performance was similar to previous sessions, with some clearer productions in imitation but limited independent accuracy. He tolerated visual and verbal cues well.\n\n4. Multiword phrases\n- Continued to model and elicit 3–4 word phrases in structured play. Client imitated many of these and produced a range of spontaneous 2–3 word utterances. Speech sound errors persisted, but his overall expressive language length was appropriate.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating final consonant production, with a gradual increase in sentence-level practice when accuracy allows.\n- Maintain targeted /s/ work, emphasizing a few functional phrases.\n- Caregiver to keep reinforcing clear endings and provide opportunities for him to slow down and repeat if not understood.\n- Next session: reassess consistency with final consonants in short sentences to determine readiness for broader generalization goals."

She continues to remind him to \"use his last sounds\" and to slow down.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client arrived energetic but cooperative. Needed some initial redirection from high-energy play to more structured tasks but settled into routines with visual supports. He responded positively to praise and game-based reinforcement.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words, phrases, and short sentences\n- Targeted final /p, t, m, n, k/ across words, short carrier phrases, and simple sentences (\"I see cup,\" \"I want hat\"). His performance was comparable to last week: many accurate final consonants in imitated words and phrases with light cueing, with more variability in spontaneous sentences. He showed good effort and willingness to retry when cued.\n\n2. Final consonants in semi-structured play\n- Incorporated final consonant targets into semi-structured play (e.g., shopping game, kitchen play). When prompted to label items or repeat short phrases, he could often include the final consonant. In his own spontaneous comments, omissions were still common, but occasional accurate final consonants occurred without prompting.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in functional words and phrases\n- Continued work with initial /s/ words and short phrases. Accuracy remained stable; he produced some clear /s/ sounds with direct models and mirror cues but required ongoing support. Independent productions were less reliable.\n\n4. Phrases for communication repair\n- Practiced simple repair strategies (e.g., repeating a word, slowing down) when not understood. Client was able to repeat short phrases on request and occasionally improved clarity on the second attempt.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain current goals focusing on stability and gradual generalization of final consonant skills.\n- Continue targeted /s/ practice with consistent cueing.\n- Caregiver to support communication repair by asking him to \"try again more slowly\" rather than guessing.\n- Next session: continue monitoring for gradual gains in spontaneous final consonant use and overall intelligibility."

She notices he leaves off the ends of a lot of words and often says “doo” or “guh” for many things.\n- No major changes since the evaluation; family has started trying to slow him down and ask him to \"say it again\" at home.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client transitioned with some hesitation but entered the room with encouragement and a preferred toy.\n- Once seated, he engaged well in play-based tasks and responded to visual supports. Attention was intermittent; needed occasional redirection back to the task when toys became too exciting.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Targeted at the imitated word level using picture cards (e.g., \"cap, cup, map, mat, mop, boat, feet\").\n- Frequently omitted final consonants or replaced them with a neutral vowel (e.g., \"ca\" for \"cap\").\n- With simultaneous productions and maximal verbal cueing (\"keep your sound at the end\"), produced final consonants in ~3–4 clear trials across the session, but accuracy was inconsistent.\n- Requires continued practice in imitation; not yet ready to move to phrases.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and syllables\n- Practiced \"back sound\" /k/ in isolation with mirror and tongue-back visual.\n- Able to approximate /k/ in isolation in about half of attempts when given strong verbal and visual cues (\"tongue up and back\"). Many productions drifted to /t/.\n- Added simple CV syllables (\"ku, ki, ko\"); accuracy low, with frequent fronting to /t/.\n\n3. Early syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Practiced simple CV (\"moo, bee, key\") and CVCV (\"mama, dada, baby\") structures in play.\n- CV shapes were generally clear and easy for him. CVCV words were produced but often with reduced clarity or merged syllables.\n- Benefited from clapping and tapping each syllable.\n\n4. Spontaneous functional words in play\n- Encouraged use of functional words (\"more, go, up, open, mine\") during play-based routines.\n- Used a small set of single words spontaneously (\"go, up, mine, ball\"), though many were distorted.\n- Needed direct models to expand beyond single-word level.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on final consonant production in CVC words at the imitated level with high support.\n- Maintain work on establishing /k/ in isolation before expanding to more syllables.\n- Encourage parents to model slow, clear CVC words in daily routines (e.g., \"cup, bed, cat\") and praise any attempts at final sounds without demanding perfect accuracy.\n- Next session: repeat similar targets to establish a consistent baseline and build comfort with therapy routines."

Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Practiced minimal pairs contrasting presence/absence of final consonant (e.g., \"bee\" vs. \"beep,\" \"see\" vs. \"seat\").\n- At the imitated word level with moderate to maximal verbal/visual cues, he produced final consonants more consistently than last week. Several short runs of 4–5 correct productions in a row were observed.\n- Still omits endings spontaneously, but there is emerging awareness; occasionally paused and attempted a self-correction when cued (\"Oh! Add your sound at the end\").\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Continued mirror work and \"back sound\" explanation.\n- Accuracy of /k/ in isolation improved compared to last session; several clear /k/ sounds produced in a row when given direct models and gestural cues.\n- In CV syllables (\"ku, ki, ko\"), he approximated /k/ in about half of attempts, with fewer substitutions to /t/.\n\n3. Initial /k/ at word level (emerging)\n- Briefly introduced simple words (\"car, key, cow\") in imitation.\n- Needed maximal modeling and simultaneous production; still primarily at the emerging level with frequent fronting (\"tar\" for \"car\").\n- A few close approximations noted (e.g., \"kar\" after a slowed model and tactile cue).\n\n4. Functional words and short phrases\n- Modeled simple two-word combinations in play (\"more bubbles,\" \"my car,\" \"go fast\").\n- He imitated several two-word phrases with variable clarity but increasing willingness to try.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue intensive practice on final consonants at the imitated CVC level; consider adding a small set of highly familiar words for home practice.\n- Maintain focus on /k/ in isolation and CV syllables; only brief, supported exposure to word-level /k/ at this time.\n- Home: parent to practice 5–10 CVC words daily using a slow model and visual cue (e.g., tapping for final sound). Emphasize effort over accuracy.\n- Next session: repeat targets and monitor whether consistency of final consonants continues to improve."

Short phrases including target sounds\n- Practiced short, functional phrases that incorporated target sounds (\"my sock,\" \"big sun,\" \"more soup\").\n- He imitated these phrases with variable but improving clarity; target sounds (/k/ and /s/) were often maintained when he slowed down.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen independence with /k/ and final consonants in words and short phrases, with increasing opportunities for spontaneous use in structured play.\n- Maintain and gradually expand the set of /s/ initial words at the imitated level; continue to emphasize clear \"snake sound\" placement.\n- Home: provide updated word lists for /k/ and /s/ practice and encourage parents to notice and praise self-corrections.\n- Next session: consider beginning to probe /k/ and final consonants in slightly longer phrases or simple sentences if current gains hold."

She notices he leaves off sounds at the ends of words and sometimes \"mumbles\" when excited.\n\nBehavior/engagement:\n- 4-year-old boy arrived with mom, transitioned to therapy room with brief hesitation but joined after being offered preferred toys.\n- Engaged well in play-based activities for short intervals (5–7 minutes) before needing redirection. Responded to visual schedule and turn-taking games.\n- Generally cheerful; some silly vocalizations when tasks became more demanding, but could be re-engaged with choices.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1) Initial /f/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- Baseline probing completed today. At the isolated sound level, he could imitate a \"quiet blowing\" /f/ in about half of opportunities when given a mirror and verbal model.\n- At the CV syllable level (\"fa, fee, foo\"), productions were frequently stopped to /p/ or omitted altogether (e.g., \"oo\" for \"foo\").\n- In initial word positions (e.g., \"fish, fan, feet, four\"), accuracy in direct imitation was low and inconsistent; many productions approximated /p/ or /b/ (\"bish\" for \"fish\"). Required maximal verbal cueing to \"bite lip and blow\" plus visual models.\n\n2) Initial /s/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- In isolation, he was able to sustain a short /s/ with combined verbal and gestural cues (\"snake sound\") in about half of attempts. Frequent stopping to /t/ or substitution with /sh/.\n- At the CV syllable level (\"see, soo, sah\"), accuracy decreased; often produced /t/ or /d/ instead.\n- Initial /s/ words (\"sun, soup, sock, soap, seat\") were attempted in imitation. Productions were mostly inaccurate, with frequent substitutions /t, d, sh/. Needed maximal cueing and slow pacing.\n\n3) Final consonant production (CVC words)\n- Informal sampling during play indicated frequent omission of final consonants, particularly in CVC words (e.g., \"ca\" for \"cat,\" \"do\" for \"dog\").\n- When provided a clear model and picture cue, he occasionally marked final /t/ and /p/, but this was not consistent.\n\n4) Baseline intelligibility / spontaneous speech\n- During play-based conversation, intelligibility to the unfamiliar listener (SLP) was reduced; required frequent clarification and repetition.\n- Noted multiple sound errors and omissions across word positions, consistent with phonological delay.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue with weekly therapy focusing on establishing accurate productions of initial /f/ and /s/ at the isolation and simple syllable levels with high levels of support.\n- Introduce visual supports (mirror, gesture cues) and simple metaphors (\"lip biting\" for /f/, \"snake sound\" for /s/).\n- Home practice: demonstrate to caregiver how to cue \"quiet /f/\" in front of a mirror for short, playful practice (1–2 minutes at a time), emphasizing fun rather than accuracy. No formal drill yet; focus on awareness and imitation."

Accuracy in isolation improved compared to last session; he was able to produce a recognizable /f/ in the majority of trials with verbal and visual cues.\n- At the CV syllable level (\"fee, foo, fa\"), he produced more consistent frication today, though still occasionally reverted to /p/ (e.g., \"pee\" for \"fee\").\n- Needed moderate verbal reminders rather than maximal cueing throughout; tolerated slowing his rate when prompted.\n\n2) Initial /f/ in simple words (imitation)\n- Practiced words such as \"fish, five, fan, feet\" in imitation.\n- Accuracy remained emerging: some clear productions were heard (e.g., several good attempts at \"fish\"), mixed with approximations like \"bish\" or \"ish\".\n- When cued to \"start with your quiet blowing sound,\" he was sometimes able to self-correct on the second attempt.\n\n3) Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)\n- Continued work on sustained /s/ with snake visual. He could hold a short /s/ more often today, though it was still occasionally stopped to /t/.\n- CV syllables (\"see, soo, sah\") remained challenging. With maximal verbal cueing and a hand gesture, he produced a few accurate \"see\" productions, but most attempts involved /t/ or /sh/.\n\n4) Final consonant production (CVC words)\n- Briefly probed final /p/ and /t/ in CVC words during a picture game (e.g., \"cup, cap, cat\"), all in imitation.\n- Continued to omit many final sounds, though there were isolated correct productions when the SLP emphasized the \"end sound\" and used a tapping cue.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on initial /f/ and /s/ in isolation and CV syllables, gradually increasing the number of word-level trials for /f/ where accuracy is emerging.\n- Maintain high level of modeling and visual cues.\n- Home practice: caregiver encouraged to play a \"quiet blowing\" game, practicing just a few /f/ sounds in front of a mirror, praising effort and any correct lip placement.

She notices difficulty with \"s\" and \"f\" sounds and some longer words. No major changes since the initial evaluation.\n\nBehavior/engagement:\nClient transitioned with some hesitation but joined the session with encouragement. Engaged well in play-based tasks, needed occasional redirection from preferred toys to practice activities. Responded positively to praise and visual supports.\n\nGoals / Session targets:\n1. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced /f/ in isolation using a mirror and visual cue for \"bite lip, blow air.\" Accuracy in isolation was inconsistent; client often replaced /f/ with /p/ or omitted the airflow. In CV syllables (\"fa, foo, fee\"), productions were mostly imitative with frequent cueing required.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in isolation\n- Targeted /s/ in isolation using snake pictures and auditory bombardment. Client produced a prolonged /s/ sound with moderate support, but tended to add a vowel (\"suh\"). Needed frequent verbal reminders to keep the tongue behind the teeth and to sustain airflow. Accuracy variable across attempts.\n\n3. Initial /s/ blends at the imitated word level\n- Introduced simple /s/ blends (\"spoon, stop, snow\") in imitation only. Client frequently omitted the /s/ (e.g., \"poon\" for \"spoon\") even with models. Tactile cues to \"add the snake sound\" at the beginning supported a few closer approximations but consistency was low.\n\n4. CVC word shapes with final consonants\n- Probed CVC words (e.g., \"cup, map, bus\"). Client often dropped the final consonant or reduced it to a very quiet sound. More success when words were broken into parts and tapped out, but final sounds were not reliably produced.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to focus on establishing /f/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables before moving up to words.\n- Encourage parent to model clear /f/ and /s/ during daily routines (e.g., \"feet,\" \"soap\"), emphasizing the mouth shape but without pressuring the child to repeat.\n- Next session: repeat baseline-style probes of initial /f/, /s/, and simple /s/ blends to monitor early change and refine targets."

Stayed engaged in table-top and floor activities for short periods, with brief breaks for movement. Accepted clinician modeling and looked at the clinician’s face during sound practice.\n\nGoals / Session targets:\n1. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV/CVC syllables\n- Client showed improved ability to shape /f/ with visual and verbal cues (\"bite your lip, blow\"). In isolation, more consistent airflow was noted, though occasional /p/ substitutions remained. In simple CVs (\"fee, foo, fa\") and a few CVCs (\"fish, fan\"), client imitated with emerging accuracy, especially when the clinician slowed the model and used a mirror.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on /s/ in isolation. Client was better able to sustain a quiet, continuous \"snake\" sound when cued to \"keep your tongue behind your teeth.\" Fewer \"suh\" additions noted compared to last session. In CV syllables (\"see, soo\"), productions were mostly imitated and still required moderate verbal reminders but were slightly clearer overall.\n\n3. Initial /s/ blends at the imitated word level\n- Practiced /s/ blends (\"spoon, star, stop, snow\") during a picture game. Client still frequently omitted the /s\" (\"tar\" for \"star\"), but produced closer approximations when the clinician segmented the blend (\"s- tar\") and then blended it. A few accurate /st-/ productions were observed with maximal cues.\n\n4. Final consonants in CVC words\n- Repeated CVC targets (\"cup, map, bus, bed\"). Final consonants remained inconsistent. Client sometimes whispered the last sound when the clinician used tapping and visual cues, indicating awareness, but did not yet produce them reliably in spontaneous play.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on establishing accurate /f/ and /s/ in syllables and early words; continue heavy modeling and visual cues.\n- Encourage parent to play \"snake sound\" and \"quiet fan\" games at home, drawing attention to mouth placement.\n- Next session: Continue with the same targets, monitoring for readiness to increase the word-level load for /f/ if accuracy continues to improve."

Needed some structure to transition from free play into speech activities but responded to visual schedules and short, game-like tasks. Good eye contact and willingness to imitate.\n\nGoals / Session targets:\n1. Initial /f/ at the word level (imitation) and emerging spontaneous use\n- Shifted emphasis to word-level /f/ (\"fish, fun, four, food, five\"). In imitation, client produced initial /f/ with noticeably higher accuracy, requiring only brief reminders for lip placement. Several spontaneous /f/-initial words were heard during play (e.g., \"fish,\" \"food\") after exposure, with minor distortions but clearly recognizable.\n\n2.

Able to maintain airflow for a few seconds when focused. In CV syllables (\"see, soo, si\"), productions were clearer with moderate cueing; occasional substitutions (e.g., /sh/ or \"th\") still occurred.\n\n3.

Client continued to omit /s/ in many attempts but showed improvement when using backward chaining (\"tar\" → \"star\"). A few accurate productions of /st-/ and /sp-/ were noted with visual and gestural cues. Consistency remains emerging but stronger than in previous weeks.\n\n4. Final consonants in CVC words\n- Revisited final /p, t, m/ in CVC words (\"map, hat, gum\"). Client produced final consonants more audibly during structured drills with tapping and slowing strategies. In spontaneous speech, final consonant deletion persisted, but there were more attempts to \"add the ending\" when reminded.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Begin to expand initial /f/ to a small set of high-frequency words and simple carrier phrases next session if accuracy remains strong.\n- Continue intensive support for /s/ in isolation and blends, emphasizing consistent airflow.\n- Home program: parent to pick 3–5 /f/ words (e.g., \"fish, four, five\") to practice once daily using a mirror, keeping practice short and positive."

Some improved awareness noted when asked \"did we hear the snake sound?\"—client could sometimes identify missing /s/.\n\n4. Final consonants in CVC words\n- Practiced final /p, t, m, n/ in a picture-card game. Client continued to omit some final consonants, though there were more audible attempts with clinician modeling and tactile cues (e.g., tapping for the last sound). Accuracy improved in slow, segmented speech but did not yet carry over into conversation.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen /f/ in carrier phrases and begin occasional trials in short sentences next session if accuracy remains high.\n- Maintain current level of support for /s/ and /s/ blends; not yet ready to move to phrase level.\n- Home practice: parent to model and elicit a few /f/ words in simple phrases (\"my feet, big fish\"), keeping practice playful."

She has not noticed much change in /s/ blends but feels the child is trying more often when corrected gently.\n\nBehavior/engagement:\nClient was energetic but cooperative. Needed some movement breaks between structured tasks but returned to work with minimal prompting. Enjoyed games with clear turn-taking and responded well to visual rewards (stickers, check marks).\n\nGoals / Session targets:\n1. Initial /f/ in short sentences and play\n- Expanded /f/ to short, structured sentences (\"I see a fish,\" \"Four feet here\") with picture supports. Client produced initial /f/ accurately in most imitated sentences, with only occasional dropping or stopping when speaking quickly. During play, several spontaneous /f/-initial words and short phrases were heard with good clarity (e.g., \"fun fish,\" \"my feet\").\n\n2. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued practice with sustained /s/ and simple CVs. Client’s control of airflow has improved; fewer \"suh\" additions and better ability to hold the sound. Still requires moderate cueing to maintain correct tongue placement. Overall clarity slightly better than previous session.\n\n3. Initial /s/ blends at the imitated word level\n- Repeated work on /st-, sp-, sk-/ words (\"star, spoon, sky, stop, skate\") using a racing game. Client remains inconsistent: often omits /s/ initially, but with backward chaining and visual cueing, can produce closer approximations on about half of attempts. Awareness of the missing /s/ is improving, though independent productions are still limited.\n\n4. Final consonants in CVC words\n- Practiced final /p, t, m, n/ in a simple board game. Client produced final consonants more clearly in drill, especially when given a visual cue to \"tap the last sound.\" In less structured play, final consonants continued to be reduced or omitted, though there were a few spontaneous accurate CVC words (e.g., \"map,\" \"hat\").\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to reinforce /f/ at sentence level and monitor for carryover into more spontaneous conversation.\n- Maintain focus on /s/ in isolation and early syllables; continue current blend work at word level as consistency is still emerging.\n- Home practice: encourage 3–5 short /f/ sentences during daily routines (e.g., \"four fish,\" \"my feet are wet\") and continue modeling clear final sounds without pressure."

Attention span was appropriate for age with brief redirections needed. Willingly imitated words and phrases and seemed to enjoy listening for \"silly\" versus \"correct\" sounds.\n\nGoals / Session targets:\n1. Initial /f/ in sentences and conversational play\n- Continued to practice /f/ in short sentences and in play-based conversation. Client produced initial /f/ in target sentences with strong accuracy and minimal cueing.

Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Ongoing work on isolation and syllables. Client maintained a more consistent /s/ when focused, with occasional tongue placement errors. In CV syllables, productions remained variable but were generally similar to last week in clarity and cueing needs.\n\n3. Initial /s/ blends at the imitated word level\n- Practiced /s/ blends again (\"star, spoon, slide, snow, skate\").

No clear shift to more independent productions yet.\n\n4. Final consonants in CVC words\n- Targeted final /p, t, k/ in a picture-matching game. Client produced some accurate final consonants when slowed and cued to \"add the last sound,\" but consistency remained similar to prior sessions. In spontaneous speech, final consonant deletion persisted.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating /f/ at sentence and conversational levels; consider adding a few new /f/ words next week.\n- Maintain current focus and cueing strategies for /s/ and /s/ blends, as skills are still stabilizing.\n- Home practice: encourage the child to \"teach\" a caregiver how to make the /f/ sound, reinforcing awareness and confidence."

No concerns with hearing, no recent illnesses.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child transitioned with some hesitation but joined the session with encouragement. Once engaged in play-based activities, participation was good. Attention span was variable; needed occasional redirection from preferred toys back to speech tasks.\n\nGoals / Session Focus:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words (p, m, t)\n- Targeted final consonants at the imitated word level using picture cards (e.g., map, mop, moon, mat). Child frequently omitted final consonants or added a vowel (e.g., \"ma\" for \"map\"). With simultaneous production and visual cueing (pointing to the end sound), child produced the final consonant in some trials but was inconsistent overall. Continued to require frequent models and reminders to \"finish the word.\"\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Introduced /k/ in isolation with tongue-back cueing (\"tongue up and back\"), using a mirror. Child was able to approximate /k/ in isolation a few times but often substituted /t/ or produced a glottal sound. Practiced CV syllables (\"ku, ki, ko\") in imitation; accuracy was low and required maximal verbal and visual cueing.\n\n3. Initial /f/ at syllable and word level (emerging)\n- Briefly probed /f/ using a \"bite lip and blow\" cue.

This was primarily exploratory to establish a baseline.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CVCV)\n- Observed production of simple CVCV words (e.g., \"bunny,\" \"baby\") during play. Child produced these more easily than CVC words but sometimes reduced to CV (e.g., \"ba\" for \"baby\"). Used clapping and tapping to mark both syllables.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to target final consonants (p, m, t) at the imitated word level with strong visual cueing next session.\n- Maintain focus on establishing consistent /k/ in isolation before expanding to more syllables.\n- Home practice: Caregiver to model \"finish the word\" with simple CVC words (e.g., up, map, mom) in daily routines, emphasizing the last sound without pressuring for perfection."

Good engagement with turn-taking games and picture books. Required moderate redirection when tasks became more challenging.\n\nGoals / Session Focus:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words (p, m, t)\n- Practiced final /p, m, t/ in CVC words at the imitated level using picture cards and a simple board game. Compared to last week, child showed a noticeable increase in attempts to mark the final consonant. Many productions were approximations (e.g., partial closure or very quiet final sounds) but were present more often. With verbal reminders to \"stop the sound at the end\" and visual pointing to the picture, child was able to produce clearer final consonants in a larger portion of trials. Still required consistent modeling but demonstrated more reliable attempts.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on /k/ in isolation and CV syllables with mirror and tongue-back cueing. Child produced a more accurate /k/ sound in isolation several times and was better able to distinguish it from /t/ when provided with auditory discrimination activities (\"Is this /t/ or /k/?\").

Participated well in structured tasks when they were embedded in games. Attention and persistence were stronger today, with fewer breaks needed.\n\nGoals / Session Focus:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words (p, m, t)\n- Targeted CVC words at the imitated and then cued independent level. Child produced final /p, m, t/ with increased consistency compared to last session, especially for high-interest words (e.g., \"pop,\" \"map,\" \"mom\").

Demonstrated good turn-taking and was receptive to feedback. Mild frustration appeared when tasks were more demanding, but he responded to brief play breaks.\n\nGoals / Session Focus:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words and short phrases\n- Focused on CVC words (p, m, t) in both imitation and simple carrier phrases (e.g., \"my map,\" \"big mop\"). Child maintained relatively strong accuracy with final consonants at the word level when given a model. In short phrases, accuracy decreased slightly but was still present in many attempts when cued to \"finish the last sound.\" This reflects emerging ability to carry over final consonants beyond single words.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in word level (imitation) and emerging phrases\n- Practiced /k/ in initial position of common words (\"car,\" \"cup,\" \"cat\") during play. Child produced /k/ correctly in many imitated trials, with fewer /t/ substitutions. Briefly trialed short phrases (e.g., \"go car,\" \"my cat\") with mixed success; /k/ tended to be clearer in isolation or single words than in phrases. Still benefited from consistent verbal and visual cues.\n\n3. Initial /f/ at word level\n- Continued work on initial /f/ with picture cards and a simple fishing game (\"fish,\" \"fan,\" \"five\"). Child produced /f/ more reliably in imitation, especially when watching the clinician's mouth. Occasional /p/ substitutions persisted, but child was often able to adjust after a model. Accuracy is slowly increasing but still requires similar level of cueing as last week.\n\n4. Syllable structure and intelligibility in short utterances\n- Observed spontaneous two- and three-word phrases in play (e.g., \"my turn,\" \"more bubbles\"). Some final consonant omissions and sound substitutions impacted overall clarity, but syllable structure was generally maintained.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue to consolidate final consonant production at the phrase level, especially with high-interest vocabulary.\n- Maintain focus on /k/ at word level and carefully expand phrase-level practice as tolerated.\n- Home practice: Encourage simple phrases with known words (e.g., \"my car,\" \"big cup\"), modeling clear final sounds and praising attempts, without expecting every production to be perfect."

No new medical or developmental concerns.\n\nBehaviour/Engagement:\n- Child entered the room independently and engaged well with structured play. Attention to tasks was generally good, with only brief redirections needed. Demonstrated enjoyment when he noticed he \"said it right.\"\n\nGoals / Session Focus:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words and carrier phrases\n- Continued work on final /p, m, t/ in single words and short phrases (\"my map,\" \"big cup,\" \"mom nap\"). Accuracy at the word level remained similar to last session, with consistent success when modeled. In phrases, child showed slightly more consistent marking of final consonants but still omitted them intermittently, especially when excited or speaking quickly. Cueing level was similar to last week.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at word level and simple phrases\n- Practiced initial /k/ in familiar words (\"car,\" \"cup,\" \"cookie\") and short phrases (\"go car,\" \"my cookie\"). Child maintained a similar level of accuracy to the previous session. He responded well to mirror work and \"tongue back\" cues but still required them for reliable productions. No major change in independence, though he continues to show effort and interest.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in words (imitation)\n- Targeted /f/ in initial position with picture cards and a blowing game. Child produced /f/ accurately in many imitated trials when visually cued. There was some spontaneous /f/ in known words (\"fish\") during play, but consistency remained variable. Overall performance was comparable to last week.\n\n4. Monitoring general intelligibility in play\n- In spontaneous play, child used two- and three-word utterances. Overall intelligibility to the clinician remained reduced without context, primarily due to sound substitutions and final consonant omissions. However, when the clinician knew the topic, many utterances were understandable.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue at current levels to consolidate skills, particularly phrase-level final consonants and /k/ and /f/ at the word level.\n- Consider adding visual supports (e.g., dot cues for beginning and ending sounds) more consistently.\n- Home practice: Caregiver to pick 3–4 target words for the week (e.g., \"cup,\" \"car,\" \"map\") and practice them in short phrases during routines (\"my cup,\" \"red car\")."

He responded positively to praise and was willing to repeat words multiple times. Some silliness emerged near the end of the session, managed with brief movement breaks.\n\nGoals / Session Focus:\n1. Final consonant production in CVC words and short phrases\n- Continued targeting final /p, m, t/ in CVC words and short carrier phrases.

Child's accuracy in imitation remained stable, with clear productions when using the \"bite lip and blow\" strategy. Generalization to less structured play was limited but occasionally observed.\n\n4. General intelligibility and syllable structure\n- During spontaneous play, child produced 2–3 word phrases with overall syllable structure intact. Intelligibility to the clinician remained moderate; context continued to be helpful.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Maintain current focus to allow consolidation of gains. Continue working on consistency rather than introducing many new targets.\n- Home practice: Encourage child to \"check the ending\" of a small set of CVC words (e.g., \"cup,\" \"map,\" \"cat\"), using simple visual supports (pointing to the mouth or tapping a picture) as reminders."

No formal practice at home yet; family is interested in ideas for how to help.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance.\n- Once engaged in toys, he was cheerful and talkative. Attention to structured tasks was brief (1–2 minutes) and benefited from frequent changes in activities and use of play-based tasks.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: Establish accurate production of /s/ in initial position at the syllable and word level (imitation).\n- Baseline probes in play showed frequent substitutions/omissions for initial /s/ (e.g., “tun” for “sun,” “ock” for “sock”).\n- In isolation, child could approximate /s/ with maximal verbal and visual cueing (e.g., “snake sound,” mirror work), but productions were inconsistent.\n- At the syllable level (e.g., “see, soo, sah”), he required simultaneous production with the clinician and hand cues; accuracy was low and variable. We remained primarily at isolation today.\n\nGoal 2: Establish /f/ in initial position at the syllable and word level (imitation).\n- Informal probe revealed frequent stopping to /p/ or omission (e.g., “pish” for “fish,” “pive” for “five”).\n- With direct teaching and mirror support, child was able to place top teeth on bottom lip with tactile cue from SLP in some trials, but voicing and airflow were inconsistent.\n- Able to imitate /f/ in isolation intermittently; carryover into simple syllables (\"fee, foo\") was limited.\n\nGoal 3: Explore syllable shapes (CV, CVC, CVCV) in play to assess motor speech and sound patterning.\n- During child-led play, a variety of syllable shapes were heard (C, V, CV, CVC, CVCV with same consonant). Some final consonant deletion was noted (e.g., “ca” for “cat,” “do” for “dog”).\n- Longer words (e.g., “banana,” “elephant”) were reduced, with only 1–2 syllables clearly marked.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to establish consistent /s/ and /f/ in isolation and simple syllables with high levels of support before moving to more complex word positions.\n- Provide parent with simple modeling strategies (e.g., slowing down speech, emphasizing target sounds, using “snake sound” and “bunny teeth on lip” visuals) and encourage them to notice, not correct, at this stage.\n- Next session will focus on brief, highly supported practice of /s/ and /f/ in isolation and CV syllables within motivating play routines."

They reported that familiar listeners usually understand the child, but new people often ask for repeats.\n- Parent notices that the child often leaves off sounds at the ends of words and sometimes says “tup” for “cup” or “doo” for “shoe.”\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned with some initial hesitation but separated from caregiver with encouragement.\n- Once in the room, the child was curious and engaged with toys. Attention to adult-led tasks was brief (1–2 minutes) and required frequent redirection back to target activities.\n- The child responded well to visual supports and turn-taking games.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Establish baseline for speech sound production\n- During play and picture naming, frequent final consonant deletion was observed (e.g., “kee” for “keep,” “boo” for “book”).\n- Initial /p, b, m/ generally accurate in single words in imitation. Some backing of /t/ to /k/ noted in initial position.\n- Syllable shapes observed: strong use of CV and CVCV (same consonant), reduced accuracy for CVC and CVCV (different consonants).\n\n2. Final consonants (p, m, t) in CVC words – imitation\n- Targeted simple CVC words (e.g., “map, mop, cap, cat, mat”) in imitation.\n- Child produced final consonants inconsistently; often omitted or replaced with a neutral vowel (“ma-,” “ca-”).\n- With maximal verbal cueing (e.g., “use your quiet sound at the end”) and visual cue (tapping the table for the final sound), the child occasionally marked the final consonant, but accuracy was low and inconsistent.\n\n3. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables – imitation\n- Introduced /k/ as a “back sound” with mirror and tongue-back gesture.\n- In isolation, the child produced a clear /k/ in about half of attempts when given direct model and tongue placement cue; remaining attempts sounded like /t/ or a glottal stop.\n- In simple CV syllables (e.g., “koo, kah”), production was more difficult; child often reverted to /t/ (“too, tah”).\n\n4. Early /s/ in isolation – exploration only\n- Briefly explored /s/ in isolation using snake visuals. Child attempted to imitate but productions were typically stopped (/t/) or lateralized airflow, not yet consistent.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue building awareness of final consonants and back sound /k/ using play-based CVC words and mirrors.\n- Encourage caregiver to emphasize final sounds at home in a natural way (e.g., slightly stretching end sounds in words like “cup, book, cat”) without asking for direct repeats yet.\n- Next session: continue baseline-level work at isolation and simple syllable levels for /k/ and final consonants; monitor spontaneous speech patterns."

Final consonants (p, m, t) in CVC words – imitation\n- Practiced minimal sets such as “bee/beep, bow/boat, boo/book, ma/map.”\n- With direct modeling, visual tap for the end sound, and slow rate, child marked final consonants more frequently than last session, but still inconsistently.\n- Several approximations were produced (e.g., “boap” for “boat”), indicating increased awareness of an ending sound even if not fully accurate.\n\n2. Final consonants in structured play – emerging spontaneous attempts\n- During play (e.g., feeding animals, parking cars), the clinician emphasized final sounds in target words.\n- Child occasionally attempted to add a final sound independently (e.g., “boo-k,” “ma-p”), though accuracy was variable.\n- These attempts were infrequent but represent early awareness of word endings.\n\n3. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables – imitation\n- Continued with mirror and tongue-back cue. Child was more willing to watch mouth and copy movements.\n- In isolation, /k/ was produced more consistently when the clinician used a strong visual cue and slow model; errors still included /t/ substitutions.\n- In CV syllables (“koo, kah, kee”), accuracy was slightly improved with backward chaining (starting from “-oo” then adding the /k/), though the child still defaulted to /t/ at times.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CVC)\n- Practiced simple CVC structures in imitation, focusing on clear beginnings and endings (e.g., “pop, mom, tap”).\n- Child often produced clear initial consonants but reduced or omitted final consonants.\n- Some emerging three-syllable approximations were heard during play (e.g., “dinosa-” for “dinosaur”), with most syllables present but reduced precision.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue targeting CVC words with strong emphasis on final consonants, using tapping or finger counting for each sound.\n- Provide parent with 3–4 simple CVC words (e.g., “pop, map, mop, book”) to highlight in daily routines by slowing and slightly exaggerating the last sound, without pressuring the child to repeat.\n- Next session: maintain focus on final consonants and /k/ at isolation and syllable levels; monitor for opportunities to introduce word-level /k/ if accuracy continues to improve."

Initial /k/ at CV and word level – imitation\n- Continued with “back sound” cueing. In isolation, /k/ was produced accurately most of the time.\n- Transitioned to CV syllables and simple words (e.g., “key, car, cow, cookie”).\n- Child imitated several /k/-initial words with emerging consistency when given a model and visual cues. Occasional /t/ substitutions persisted, but there were more correct /k/ productions compared to previous sessions.\n\n4. Syllable structure – CVC and early multisyllabic words\n- In structured imitation, the child produced more complete CVC forms, though final consonants still dropped in spontaneous play.\n- Trialed a few multisyllabic words in imitation (e.g., “banana, dinosaur”). Most syllables were attempted, with some sound distortions and syllable reduction.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue building consistency for final consonants in CVC words and short phrases.\n- Encourage caregiver to praise any attempts at clear word endings and to model slow, clear CVC words in routines (e.g., snack time: “cup, cap”).\n- Next session: maintain focus on final consonants and /k/ at word level; consider beginning early work on /s/ in isolation if attention allows."

Final consonants (p, m, t, k) in CVC words – imitation\n- Repeated practice with familiar sets, including a few new but similar CVC words.\n- In imitation, accuracy remained comparable to previous sessions. The child produced several clear CVC words when cued, with ongoing variability.\n- There were occasional spontaneous CVC productions with marked final consonants in play, though not yet frequent.\n\n2. Final consonants in carrier phrases – imitation\n- Continued with short phrases such as “my cup,” “big map,” “see cat.”\n- With consistent cueing, the child was able to produce some phrases with accurate final consonants on the target word; performance remains somewhat inconsistent but stable.\n- Attempts at more natural rate speech often resulted in omission of the final consonant.\n\n3. Initial /k/ in words and simple phrases – imitation\n- Practiced /k/ initial words within short phrases (e.g., “my car,” “big cow,” “more cookie”) in addition to single words.\n- The child continued to produce /k/ accurately in many imitated word-level trials when cued; carryover into phrases was more variable.\n- No notable change in cueing needs relative to prior session.\n\n4. /s/ in isolation – ongoing shaping\n- Briefly revisited /s/ using visual and auditory models.\n- Child produced several attempts that were closer to target, but consistency remains limited.\n- No formal word-level /s/ work yet; this continues to be a preparatory goal.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on consolidating final consonants and /k/ in structured tasks and play.\n- Encourage parent to continue integrating target words into daily routines and to provide specific praise for clear word endings.\n- Next session: continue with current hierarchy; re-evaluate readiness to increase independence or complexity after additional consolidation."

Noted that Child often leaves off ending sounds and has trouble with “s” sounds in words like “sun” and “spoon.” No changes in health or hearing reported.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated from caregiver with brief hesitation, then transitioned into the therapy room with encouragement.\n- Engaged well with toys and books, preferred to lead play but responded to structured tasks with gentle redirection.\n- Attention to task was fair; needed frequent reminders to look at the clinician’s mouth when practicing sounds.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Establish baseline for final consonant production (CVC words)\n- Probed final /p, t, k, m, n/ in simple words (e.g., “cup, cat, cake, mom, sun”) in imitation.\n- Child frequently omitted final consonants or replaced them with a neutral vowel (e.g., “cu-,” “ca-”).\n- Occasional accurate final /m/ and /n/ in familiar words with maximal verbal and visual cueing (e.g., “keep your sound on at the end,” pointing to mouth).\n\n2. Initial /s/ at word level (imitation)\n- Introduced “snake sound” /s/ in isolation using mirror and visual cue (smile, teeth together, long airflow).\n- Child approximated /s/ in isolation inconsistently; productions were often closer to /d/ or a distorted /s/ with tongue too far forward.\n- In simple words (e.g., “sun, soup, sock”), accuracy was low; required maximal modeling and tactile cue (finger along forearm for “long sound”).\n\n3. Initial /f/ at syllable and word level (imitation)\n- Practiced /f/ in isolation using “lip-bite, quiet air” cue.\n- Child produced /f/ in isolation in a few trials with direct imitation; often substituted /p/ or omitted airflow.\n- In simple words (“fish, four, fun”), Child needed continuous modeling, visual cue in mirror, and slowed rate.\n\n4. Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV)\n- Observed spontaneous productions during play (e.g., “mama,” “nana,” “baba,” “uh-oh”).\n- CV and reduplicated CVCV shapes (e.g., “dada, baba”) were frequent; limited use of alternating CVCV shapes (e.g., “baby”) without model.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build awareness of final sounds and “long” sounds (/s/, /f/) at the imitated word level.\n- Encourage caregiver to model clear final sounds in daily routines (e.g., emphasize “cup,” “bed,” “up”) without asking Child to repeat every time.\n- Next session: further probe final consonants and initial /s/ and /f/; consider using picture cards and simple games to increase motivation and consistency."

Noted that Child has been “copying” some words more at home, especially during book reading, but still often drops the ends of words.\n- No new medical or hearing concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned into the room more smoothly today, separating from caregiver with minimal prompting.\n- Remained engaged in turn-taking games and tolerated brief structured practice interspersed with play.\n- Required occasional redirection when tasks became more challenging (tended to switch topics or move to another toy).\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words (imitation)\n- Targeted final /m, n, p/ in picture naming and play (e.g., “gum, moon, cup, map”).\n- With maximal verbal cueing (“keep your sound on at the end”) and visual cue (tapping a dot for the final sound), Child produced some accurate final /m/ and /n/ in imitation.\n- Final /p/ remained more difficult; often omitted or replaced with a glottal stop.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Reviewed “snake sound” with mirror. Child showed slightly more consistent airflow but continued to place tongue too far forward at times.\n- In CV syllables (e.g., “see, soo, sah”), Child achieved a few clear /s/ productions with maximal modeling and slowing.\n- Still not yet ready to move to phrase level; accuracy remains variable.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued “lip-bite, quiet air” practice.

No new medical or developmental concerns reported.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Client transitioned to the therapy room with brief hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance. He was curious and engaged in play-based activities, needing occasional redirection from preferred toys back to speech tasks. Tolerated structured turn-taking games.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. Establish /f/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Targeted /f/ sound in isolation using mirror and visual cueing for \"bite lip, blow air.\" Client was able to approximate /f/ with clear airflow in about half of opportunities, but often substituted /p/ or omitted airflow. In CV syllables (\"fo,\" \"fee\"), productions were largely inaccurate without direct imitation. He responded best to slow models and exaggerated lip positioning.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation with visual and auditory models. Client frequently produced /t/ or /d/ in place of /s/. With maximal verbal cueing (\"long, quiet snake sound\") and some tactile cues to keep tongue behind teeth, he produced a recognizable /s/ intermittently. In simple CV syllables (\"see,\" \"soo\"), accuracy was low; he tended to stop the sound or shorten it.\n\n3. Simple CVC words with final consonants (general consonant marking)\n- Used picture cards and play-based routines (e.g., \"pop,\" \"bed,\" \"map\") to probe final consonant production. Client frequently omitted final consonants, especially in spontaneous attempts. With direct imitation and segmenting (\"ma-p\"), he marked some final sounds but was inconsistent and required significant support.\n\n4. Baseline probe of multisyllabic word production\n- Briefly sampled 2–3 syllable words during play (\"banana,\" \"dinosaur,\" \"potato\"). Client generally produced a reduced syllable shape (e.g., \"nana\" for \"banana\") and did not yet respond to syllable-tapping cues.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to build awareness and accuracy of /f/ and /s/ at the isolation and simple syllable level with high support.\n- Maintain focus on marking final consonants in high-interest CVC words.\n- Provide parent with simple modeling strategies (slow speech, emphasizing final sounds) during shared book reading.\n- Next session: re-check /f/ and /s/ in isolation, consider introducing a small set of high-frequency CVC words for more structured practice."

He was playful and occasionally silly, which sometimes interfered with accurate imitation. With gentle prompts and visual timers, he returned to tasks and participated well in short, structured activities.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. /f/ in isolation and CV/CVC syllables\n- Reviewed /f/ in isolation using mirror and visual cues. Client produced a clearer /f/ more consistently when reminded to \"bite lip and blow,\" showing better control of airflow compared to last session. In CV combinations (\"fee,\" \"foo\"), accuracy improved with imitation. He was able to produce a few CVC words (\"feet,\" \"fun\") with partial accuracy, though he often reduced to CV or substituted /p/ initially.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on /s/ in isolation. Client demonstrated more frequent recognizable /s/ sounds when given a slow model and cue to keep tongue behind teeth. Still tended to shorten the sound or shift to /t/ without cues, but there were more correct attempts than last week. In simple CV syllables (\"see,\" \"sue\"), he had a few accurate productions with maximal modeling.\n\n3. CVC words with final consonants\n- Practiced high-interest CVC words (\"pop,\" \"bus,\" \"cup\") in a turn-taking game. Client continued to omit final consonants in spontaneous attempts but showed emerging ability to mark some final sounds during imitation. Needed segmented models (\"cu-p\") and visual cueing (pointing to end of word) to support final consonant production.\n\n4. Early multisyllabic words (2-syllable focus)\n- Briefly revisited 2-syllable words (\"baby,\" \"nana,\" \"spider\") with clapping for each beat. Client began to tolerate clapping and could sometimes produce both syllables when strongly cued, though consonant clarity remained limited.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue current targets; emerging improvement noted in /f/ and /s/ accuracy with high levels of cueing.\n- Encourage caregiver to model slow, stretched productions of target words during play, praising any attempts.\n- Next session: maintain focus on /f/ and /s/ in CV/CVC contexts and continue practice with a small set of CVC words emphasizing final consonants."

He engaged readily in structured play and accepted therapist-led activities with minimal protest. Attention to task was better sustained today, with fewer off-topic behaviors and good response to visual supports.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. /f/ in initial position at word level\n- Targeted initial /f/ in a small set of words (\"fish,\" \"foot,\" \"fun,\" \"four\") at the imitated word level. Client produced a clear /f/ at the beginning of these words in many attempts when given a single model and brief verbal cue (\"bite lip, blow\").

Still needed frequent reminders to keep tongue behind teeth, but he required fewer repetitions of the model to achieve a recognizable /s/.\n\n3. CVC words with final consonants (high-frequency set)\n- Continued work on final consonants using a limited set of functional words (\"pop,\" \"bus,\" \"cup,\" \"bed\"). Client marked final consonants more often in imitation today and occasionally attempted to mark them spontaneously during the game. Errors included sound omissions and devoicing. He benefited from slow, segmented models and pointing to the end of the picture.\n\n4.

He seemed to enjoy the tapping routine and followed along.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Given moderate gains, continue to strengthen /f/ initial at the word level and expand the word list.\n- Maintain work on initial /s/ in CV/CVC words with consistent cues, and continue practicing final consonants in a small set of functional words.\n- Encourage parent to use the \"tap and say\" strategy for some 2-syllable words at home.\n- Next session: consider trialing simple carrier phrases for /f/ words if accuracy remains strong."

Final consonant production in CVC words\n- Practiced final consonants in a focused set of words (\"bus,\" \"cup,\" \"bed,\" \"map\"). Client maintained similar performance to last session, with some correct productions in imitation but frequent omissions in spontaneous attempts. He responded to segmented models and tapping cues but still required considerable support to carry over to independent productions.\n\n4. Two-syllable words with tapping and modeling\n- Revisited 2-syllable words (\"happy,\" \"spider,\" \"daddy\") using tapping for each syllable. Client reliably produced both syllables when strongly cued and appeared more aware of the \"two-part\" structure of the words. Consonant accuracy continued to vary, but syllable marking was more consistent.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to consolidate /f/ initial at word and short phrase levels, as skills are strengthening.\n- Maintain focus on /s/ in CVC words with ongoing cues and practice.\n- Keep practicing final consonants with a small, functional word set; performance is stable and still developing.\n- Encourage caregiver to practice short /f/ phrases at home (e.g., \"fun food,\" \"five fish\") during daily routines."

Performance was similar to last week: client marked some final consonants during imitation but continued to omit them frequently without direct prompting. He benefited from slowed speech and emphasis on \"end sounds\" but is not yet carrying this over independently.\n\n4. Two-syllable words (2-beat structure)\n- Continued 2-syllable word practice (\"spider,\" \"happy,\" \"daddy\") with tapping and visual supports.

Establish baseline for target sounds (/k/, /g/, /s/, /f/)\n- During play and picture naming, child frequently fronted /k, g/ to /t, d/ (e.g., \"tat\" for \"cat,\" \"doe\" for \"go\").\n- /s/ was often reduced or changed to /d/ or /t/ in initial position (e.g., \"doap\" for \"soap\").\n- /f/ in initial position was usually replaced with /p/ (e.g., \"pish\" for \"fish\").\n- Overall intelligibility in connected speech estimated to be reduced, especially for unfamiliar listeners.\n\n2. /k/ in isolation and simple syllables (imitation)\n- Introduced \"back sound\" concept with mirror and tongue depressor for visual reference.\n- With maximal verbal and gestural cueing (touching throat, \"back sound\" gesture), child produced /k/ in isolation inconsistently; able to approximate 3–4 times but often reverted to /t/.\n- Attempted CV syllables (\"koo,\" \"kay\"), but productions were mainly /too/, /tay/.\n\n3. /f/ initial in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)\n- Modeled \"lip-bite and blow\" strategy using mirror and picture of a face.\n- With direct imitation and visual cueing, child was able to approximate /f/ in isolation in about half of attempts; often produced /h/ or /p/ instead.\n- Able to imitate simple CV syllables (\"fee,\" \"foo\") with heavy modeling and slow rate; accuracy inconsistent.\n\n4. Early syllable shapes and clarity in CVCV words\n- Observed use of CV, VC, and CVCV (same consonant) patterns during play (e.g., \"mama,\" \"dada,\" \"nana\").\n- In longer CVCV words (e.g., \"bunny,\" \"teddy\"), some consonants were omitted or simplified, impacting clarity.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to focus on establishing /k/ and /f/ in isolation and simple syllables with strong visual supports.\n- Introduce a small set of functional words with /f/ (e.g., \"fish,\" \"fun\") once isolation is more consistent.\n- Home practice: encouraged parent to play in front of a mirror for short periods, practicing \"lip-bite and blow\" for /f/ with lots of praise for attempts, not perfection.\n- Plan to gather more detailed baseline next session for /s/ and final consonants."

No formal home practice completed yet as this was the first session.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned with some hesitation but joined play with moderate support. Once engaged, they were cheerful and talkative, though speech was often unintelligible in connected speech. Attended to adult-led tasks for short bursts (2–3 minutes) with frequent redirection back to the table.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Baseline of overall speech sound production\n- Informal play-based sample taken. Frequent omissions of final consonants (e.g., \"ca\" for \"cat,\" \"pi\" for \"pig\"), and reduced consonant blends (e.g., \"pane\" for \"plane\"). Vowel productions generally intact. Intelligibility to clinician estimated as low-to-moderate in conversation.\n\n2. Final consonant production (p, m, t) in CVC words – imitated level\n- Targeted words such as \"map, mop, mat, cat, cup.\" Child was often able to add a final consonant when given a clear model and visual cue (pointing to the end of the word picture), but productions were inconsistent. Tended to add an extra vowel (e.g., \"muh-puh\") or omit the final sound entirely without cues.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in syllables and simple words – imitated level\n- Practiced /f/ in isolation (\"ffff\") and in CV syllables (\"fa, fee, foo\") with visual cue of \"bitting lip and blowing air.\" Child needed frequent reminders and tended to substitute /p/ or /h/ for /f/. A few clear productions were heard with simultaneous clinician modeling.\n\n4. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple CV syllables – imitated level\n- Introduced \"snake sound\" /s/ in isolation. Child attempted to copy the clinician but often produced /t/ or a short, stopped sound. Could briefly hold /s/ with maximal verbal and visual cues (\"keep teeth together, blow air\"). Not yet ready to move to words.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build awareness of final consonants and introduce consistent practice for /f/ and /s/ in isolation and syllables. Caregiver encouraged to model \"quiet snake sound\" /s/ and \"lip-bite\" /f/ during daily routines (e.g., \"feet,\" \"food,\" \"soap\") without pressuring the child to repeat. Next session will further probe which sounds are most stimulable for goal setting."

No structured practice completed yet; caregiver requested ideas for short, play-based activities.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated more smoothly from caregiver today and moved into the therapy room willingly. Enjoyed turn-taking games and responded well to visual rewards (stickers). Attention improved compared to last visit, with the child able to stay with table tasks for slightly longer segments.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final consonants (p, m, t) in CVC words – imitated level\n- Practiced words such as \"cup, cap, mop, map, mat, meat.\" With a clear model and visual cue (tapping the table for the final sound), child produced final consonants more frequently than last session, though accuracy remained variable. Some self-corrections were observed when the clinician repeated the word with emphasis on the final sound.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in syllables and single words – imitated level\n- Continued practice with \"lip-bite\" /f/ using a mirror. Child showed better awareness of how to place the teeth and lips, but still reverted to /p/ without support. In structured imitation, there were a few more accurate CV productions (\"fee, foo\") than previously, with less need for hand-over-hand prompting. Word-level attempts (\"fish, fun, four\") were mostly approximations.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables – imitated level\n- Revisited \"snake sound\" /s/. Child was more willing to watch the clinician's mouth and listen to the long sound. Still required maximal verbal and visual cues to achieve a continuous /s/. CV attempts (\"see, soo\") were mostly distorted or stopped, but the child showed increased effort and interest in trying.\n\n4. Overall intelligibility in play\n- During open play, continued to omit many final consonants and reduce clusters. The clinician occasionally modeled slightly clearer versions of the child's words in a natural way. Child did not yet spontaneously imitate these models.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on final consonants and initial /f/ and /s/ in structured imitation tasks. Provide caregiver with one simple home activity: practice 3–4 picture words with final /p/ or /m/ (e.g., \"map, mop, mom\") once per day, emphasizing the final sound with a gentle tap or point. Next session will explore whether any additional sounds are highly stimulable to help refine therapy priorities."

They noticed the child occasionally added a \"p\" at the end of \"cup\" or \"up\" after being reminded. No concerns about hearing or health this week.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered the room readily and was eager to show toys. Participated well in structured activities with brief movement breaks. Responded positively to specific praise about \"strong sounds\" and enjoyed listening games.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final /p/ and /m/ in CVC words – imitated and cued level\n- Targeted a small set of words (\"map, mop, cap, cup, mom, ham\") using picture cards and a simple game. Compared to last week, the child produced more consistent final consonants when given a model and visual cue (pointing to the end of the word). Some productions were accurate with only a light reminder rather than full modeling. A few spontaneous corrections were noted when the clinician asked, \"Did you remember the last sound?\"\n\n2. Initial /f/ in CV and CVC words – imitated level\n- Used mirror work and a \"blowing\" theme (\"fan, fish, food\"). Child demonstrated improved placement for /f/ in isolation and could produce a short continuous /f/ when prompted. Accuracy for CV syllables increased, and a few clear productions of \"fish\" and \"feet\" were heard with direct imitation and visual cues. Still not yet independent but requiring slightly fewer prompts.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple CV syllables – imitated level\n- Continued with \"snake sound\" using a toy snake and visual of air flow. Child was able to sustain /s/ for a brief moment with the clinician's model and verbal cue to \"keep teeth together.\" Attempts at \"see\" and \"sun\" remained inconsistent, with frequent substitutions or distortions, but there was more willingness to practice multiple trials.\n\n4. Early word-level practice for final /t/ – stimulability probing\n- Briefly probed final /t/ in words like \"cat, hat, hot\". Child was sometimes able to add a light /t/ when given a slow model and a tap cue. This will be monitored for potential inclusion as a formal target.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen final /p/ and /m/ at the word level, aiming for more consistent accuracy with reduced cueing. Maintain current work on /f/ in syllables and initial word attempts. Encourage caregiver to model and highlight final consonants in everyday words (e.g., \"cup,\" \"mom\") and to praise any attempts by the child to \"add the last sound.\""

Participated in table tasks for several short rounds and accepted clinician-led choices. Mild silliness at times, but easily redirected with visual schedules and concrete expectations.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final /p/ and /m/ in CVC words – imitated and emerging spontaneous level\n- Used a matching game with target words (\"cap, cup, map, mop, mom, ham, gum\"). Child produced final /p/ and /m/ more consistently than previous sessions when given a model and a brief cue. In familiar words like \"cup\" and \"mom,\" child occasionally produced the final sound independently during play. When prompted to \"say it one more time,\" accuracy often improved without the need for a full model.\n\n2. Final /t/ in CVC words – imitated level\n- Focused on words such as \"cat, hat, hot, net.\" With a slow model and gesture cue (tapping the end of the picture), child was able to add a soft /t/ in several attempts. Production was not yet consistent across the set, but this represents a step forward from last session's brief probing.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in CVC words – imitated level, expanding set\n- Continued mirror practice, then moved into a small group of words (\"feet, fun, fish, four\"). Child showed more reliable placement and was able to produce /f/ at the beginning of words when directly imitating. Fewer substitutions to /p/ were heard, though some productions remained unclear in connected speech.\n\n4. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV – imitated level\n- Shorter practice segment on /s/ to maintain familiarity. Child could produce a brief continuous /s/ with model and cueing. Attempts in CV syllables (\"see, soo\") showed some improvement in airflow control but still required maximal support.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Begin to build more opportunities for spontaneous final consonant use in structured play, while maintaining direct practice for final /p, m, t/ at the word level. Continue strengthening initial /f/ at word level and keep /s/ in the routine as a shorter, high-support target.

Attentive for short, repeated practice bursts embedded in play (e.g., racing cars, feeding animals). Enjoyed choosing between two target pictures. Needed occasional prompts to stay seated but returned easily.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final /p, m, t/ in CVC words – imitated and cued spontaneous level\n- Continued work with picture cards and a simple board game. Child demonstrated more consistent accuracy for final /p/ and /m/ in high-frequency words and improved performance with final /t/. With a single reminder (\"remember the last sound\"), the child often produced the full CVC word without needing the clinician to say it first. Some spontaneous final consonants were heard during game play when the child named familiar pictures.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in CVC words – imitated and cued level; early carrier phrase attempts\n- Practiced words such as \"fish, feet, fun, food\" and began to introduce short carrier phrases (\"my fish,\" \"more feet\") with heavy support. Child showed better control over the /f/ placement and produced several clear initial /f/ words in direct imitation. When phrases were attempted, the child tended to maintain the /f/ but dropped some final consonants.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple words – imitated level\n- Spent a brief portion of the session on /s/ using a toy snake and visual cue for airflow. Child could produce a short /s/ on request with full support and attempted a few /s/ initial words (\"sun, soup, sock\") in imitation. Accuracy remained variable, but there was slightly improved control of the continuous airflow.\n\n4. Intelligibility in structured play\n- In a simple play routine (feeding toy animals), the child was more easily understood when using words that had been practiced earlier in the session, especially those with improved final consonants. Longer utterances remained more challenging to understand.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue consolidating final /p, m, t/ at word level and begin to create more opportunities for short phrases with at least one clear final consonant. Maintain and gradually expand initial /f/ word set, keeping carrier phrases short and highly supported.

Participated in structured tasks with good effort and responded well to specific feedback (\"I heard your last sound!\"). Some impulsive responding, but generally cooperative and engaged.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Final /p, m, t/ in CVC words – imitated, cued, and emerging independent level\n- Used a spinner game with mixed final consonant targets (\"cup, cap, map, mop, mom, ham, cat, hat, hot\"). Child continued to show solid performance when given a model or brief reminder. There were more instances of accurate final consonants without the clinician saying the word first, particularly for well-practiced items. Occasional omissions and distortions persisted, but overall consistency is trending upward.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in CVC words and short phrases – imitated and cued level\n- Practiced \"fish, feet, fun, food, fire\" within a simple play scenario (feeding animals, pretend picnic). Child produced initial /f/ more reliably in imitation, and a few clear productions were heard within short phrases (\"my fish,\" \"more food\") when the clinician provided a model and gestural cue. Final consonant accuracy decreased somewhat in phrases, which is expected at this stage.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and word level – imitated level\n- Maintained /s/ practice using a brief drill segment. Child could produce a more sustained /s/ with clinician modeling and visual cue. In words like \"sun\" and \"sock,\" accuracy remained inconsistent, though there were a few clearer productions than in previous weeks. Child required ongoing maximal support.\n\n4. Intelligibility in structured play and short utterances\n- During a short \"shopping\" game, the child was somewhat easier to understand when using target words that included practiced final consonants or /f/ initial words. Longer, spontaneous sentences remained less intelligible due to ongoing omissions and substitutions.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue working on final /p, m, t/ with a goal of increasing independence at the word level and gradually in short, functional phrases.

In short phrases, accuracy decreased but remained better than previous weeks, especially when the clinician highlighted the final sound in the last word of the phrase.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in CVC words and two-word combinations – imitated and cued level\n- Used a picture scene to practice words (\"fish, feet, food, fan, five\") and short phrases (\"my fish,\" \"more food,\" \"five feet\").

At the single-word level, final consonant accuracy remained relatively strong for well-practiced items with minimal cueing. In phrases, performance was similar to last week: the child could produce clear final consonants when the clinician slowed down and highlighted the last sound, but tended to drop them during faster or more spontaneous attempts.\n\n2.

He was generally cooperative and responded well to visual supports. Attention to task was variable; he needed redirection when activities were less preferred but returned to work with encouragement and short movement breaks.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Establish /sh/ in isolation\n- Targeted /sh/ in isolation using mirror work, auditory bombardment, and “quiet sound” cueing. Client produced an approximation of /sh/ with clinician modeling and hand cue at about half of opportunities. He tended to substitute /s/ or /t/ when the tongue did not retract. Able to hold a prolonged “shhh” for 1–2 seconds with direct imitation.\n\n2. Initial /sh/ in simple syllables (CV)\n- Practiced CV syllables (e.g., “she,” “shoo,” “sha”) in imitation. Accuracy was inconsistent; he was most successful on “she” and “shoo” when paired with picture cues and slowed rate. Required frequent verbal reminders to “lip out, tongue back.”\n\n3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV\n- Elicited /s/ in isolation with snake visual. Client could imitate a sustained /s/ with intermittent stopping to /t/. With verbal cue to “keep teeth together” and model, he produced clearer /s/ about half the time. CV syllables (e.g., “see,” “soo”) were attempted; these were more challenging, with frequent omission or substitution.\n\n4. Final consonant awareness\n- In play, SLP modeled final consonants (e.g., “bus,” “dog,” “cup”) with visual emphasis and minimal pairs (e.g., “bee” vs “beep”). Client was able to notice a difference when the final sound was exaggerated but did not yet consistently add final sounds in imitation.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue to build consistency of /sh/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables before moving to word level. Provide parents with simple “quiet sound” (/sh/) and “snake sound” (/s/) practice sheets for short, play-based practice at home (5 minutes, 3–4 times/week), focusing on listening and a few imitated sounds rather than accuracy. Monitor final consonant production in familiar words in upcoming sessions."

She has not noticed big changes in word clarity yet but feels he is trying to copy her more often. No new medical concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient entered the room more readily today and quickly engaged in play-based activities. He was cheerful and talkative, with occasional silliness that required gentle redirection. He responded well to visual schedules and short, varied tasks.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. /sh/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Reviewed /sh/ in isolation; client produced a clear, sustained /sh/ in most imitated attempts when using the visual cue (finger to lips). Accuracy was higher than last week, with fewer /s/ substitutions. Transitioned to CV syllables (e.g., “she,” “shy,” “shoe”); he imitated these with emerging consistency, especially “she” and “shoe.” Needed moderate verbal cueing to keep his tongue back and lips rounded.\n\n2. Initial /sh/ at single-word level (imitation)\n- Introduced simple /sh/-initial words (e.g., shoe, sheep, shark, shop) in picture naming with direct imitation. Client achieved several accurate productions, particularly with high-interest items (shark, shoe). Errors included reducing to /s/ or omitting the initial sound. With repetition and slowed rate, he could often correct with support.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced sustained /s/ with snake visual. Client demonstrated slightly improved control, with longer and clearer productions when watching the clinician’s mouth. In CV syllables, he produced approximations (e.g., “dee” for “see”) but was able to move toward /s/ with repeated modeling and tactile cue to keep tongue behind teeth.\n\n4. Awareness of final consonants in play\n- Continued minimal pair listening tasks (e.g., “bee/beep,” “boo/boot”) using toy-based games. Client was engaged in pointing to the picture he heard and showed good listening discrimination for some pairs. Still rarely added final sounds in his own spontaneous words.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nMaintain focus on /sh/ in isolation and CV, and continue early work on /sh/-initial words in imitation, as he is showing a noticeable increase in accuracy. Keep /s/ work at isolation/CV level for now. Home practice: short daily “quiet sound” games and a few /sh/ words (shoe, shark) in imitation, emphasizing fun and not correcting every error."

She also noticed occasional clearer /s/ in words like “sun,” though it is still inconsistent. Preschool teacher mentioned his speech is a “little easier to understand” during circle time.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned smoothly and participated well with minimal protest. He remained seated for structured tasks for longer periods than in previous sessions and responded positively to praise and token rewards. Brief fatigue was noted near the end of session, but he was able to re-engage with a movement break.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Initial /sh/ at word level (imitation → cued spontaneous)\n- Targeted /sh/-initial words (shoe, sheep, shark, shop, shell) using picture cards and play. Client produced these with improved accuracy in imitation, often correct on the first or second attempt. Began to reduce the amount of cueing; he could sometimes say “shoe” or “shark” in a short phrase (e.g., “my shoe”) after a model. Occasional carryover into spontaneous play (e.g., labeling a toy shark) when visually prompted.\n\n2. /sh/ in simple carrier phrases (imitation)\n- Introduced carrier phrase “my ___” and “I see ___” with /sh/-initial targets. With direct modeling, he produced short phrases such as “my shoe” and “I see shark” with emerging accuracy. Needed frequent reminders to keep the /sh/ sound, but was able to self-correct a few times when he heard himself say /s/.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued practice of sustained /s/ with mirror and snake cue. Client showed better consistency in holding the sound without stopping to /t/. In CV syllables (see, soo, say), he produced closer approximations, with some clearly recognizable /s/ on initial attempts. Still required moderate verbal and visual cues.\n\n4. Initial /s/ words (early introduction in imitation)\n- Briefly trialed simple /s/-initial words (sun, sock, soup) at the imitated word level. Accuracy was variable; he often substituted /d/ or omitted the initial sound. With slowed rate and segmentation (“s-oo-p”), he could approximate the target in some trials, indicating readiness to continue exploring this level.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nGiven the moderate progress, expand practice of /sh/-initial words and short phrases, continuing to fade cues as tolerated. Keep /s/ work primarily at isolation/CV with brief trials at word level. Encourage parents to practice 3–5 /sh/ words in simple phrases at home (e.g., “my shoe,” “big shark”) during daily routines."

He was talkative and eager to show toys from home. Participation in structured tasks was generally good, though he occasionally rushed through repetitions and needed reminders to slow down. He responded well to turn-taking games and visual timers.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1. Initial /sh/ at word level (imitation and less-cued productions)\n- Practiced a larger set of /sh/-initial words (shoe, shark, ship, shop, shell, sheep) in picture naming and play. Accuracy in imitation remained strong, with many clear productions. When cues were reduced (e.g., no hand gesture), he still produced recognizable /sh/ in many attempts, though some reverted to /s/ or were omitted. Demonstrated more consistent self-correction when given time.\n\n2. /sh/ in carrier phrases and short sentences\n- Continued “my ___” and “I see ___” phrases and introduced simple sentences like “I want shark” and “I found a shell.” Client produced these mostly with models and visual sentence strips. Accuracy of the /sh/ word within the phrase was emerging; he required reminders but could often produce one or two clear /sh/ words per short sentence.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and early word-level trials\n- Reviewed sustained /s/ in isolation. Client maintained clearer /s/ with less need for tactile cueing, though he still benefited from watching the clinician’s mouth. Tried a small set of /s/-initial words (sun, sock, soup, sit) in imitation. Accuracy was slightly improved compared with last week, with a few clearly produced /s/ on first attempt. However, consistency remains limited, and he still needs significant modeling and segmentation.\n\n4. Final consonant awareness and early production\n- Incorporated final consonants into play (e.g., “bus,” “cup,” “dog”) using minimal pairs and tapping for the last sound. Client showed growing awareness when listening and could sometimes add a final sound in imitation (e.g., “cup”) when cued to “add the last sound.” Spontaneous use of final consonants continues to be limited.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue consolidating /sh/ at word and short-phrase levels, aiming for more consistent productions with lighter cueing. Maintain /s/ at isolation and early word-level practice, focusing on a small set of familiar words. Encourage parents to prompt short phrases with /sh/ (e.g., “my shoe,” “big shark”) in play and to model final consonants by emphasizing the last sound in key words."

Client could produce clear /sh/ words within these sentences when directly imitating the clinician. When asked to generate his own sentence, he sometimes omitted the target word or reduced the /sh/ to /s/. Skills appear to be consolidating at this level rather than advancing significantly.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and selected words\n- Practiced sustained /s/ in front of a mirror; performance was comparable to last week, with intermittent clear productions and occasional stopping to /t/. In imitated words (sun, sock, soup, sit), he produced some accurate /s/ but remained inconsistent. He continues to rely on visual and verbal cues.\n\n4.

Client could sometimes add the final consonant when it was heavily modeled and segmented (e.g., “cu—p”). However, these productions were not yet consistent, and he needed substantial cueing.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nMaintain current focus areas, as skills are stabilizing at this level.

When successful, child could hold the sound briefly but had difficulty maintaining consistent airflow.\n- At CV syllable level (\"see, soo\"), accuracy was low; child frequently produced \"tee, doo\" despite models.\n\n2) Initial /s/ at imitated word level\n- Targeted initial /s/ in simple words (sun, soup, sock, soap, sad) using picture cards.\n- With direct imitation and maximal verbal and visual cues, child produced approximations in some trials but often substituted /t/ (\"tun\" for sun) or deleted the initial consonant.\n- Accuracy was inconsistent; child required repeated models and slow pacing.\n\n3) Early /s/ blends awareness\n- Introduced /s/ blends (e.g., stop, spin, star) only for auditory discrimination and awareness.\n- Child enjoyed listening for the \"snake sound\" at the beginning of words and could point to pictures when the clinician emphasized /s/ about half the time.\n- No expectation for independent production at this time; productions were largely reduced to the second consonant or simplified (e.g., \"top\" for stop).\n\n4) Baseline for final consonants in simple CVC words\n- Probed final /t/ and /p/ in play (hat, hot, up, cup). Child frequently omitted final consonants in spontaneous speech (\"ha\" for hat, \"uh\" for up).\n- With simultaneous production and gesture cue (tapping the table for the final sound), child was able to mark some final consonants but not consistently.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to establish a consistent /s/ sound in isolation and simple CV syllables before increasing word-level demands.\n- Maintain short, play-based activities with frequent movement breaks to support attention.\n- Home practice: caregiver to model long \"snake sound\" /s/ during daily routines (e.g., \"sssssock,\" \"ssssoup\"), encouraging the child to listen and occasionally try the sound, without pressure for accuracy."

Able to imitate a clear /s/ in most attempts when given time to prepare (\"teeth together, air through the middle\").\n- Introduced more CV syllables (\"see, soo, sah\"). Accuracy improved compared to last session; child produced a recognizable /s/ at the beginning of about half of trials with moderate cueing.\n- Child began to self-correct occasionally after hearing their own production (e.g., trying again after producing \"tee\" for \"see\").\n\n2) Initial /s/ at imitated word level\n- Practiced initial /s/ words (sun, soap, sock, soup, sad) with picture support and a pacing board.\n- With imitation and moderate verbal/visual cues, child produced closer approximations than last week, with fewer /t/ substitutions.\n- Accuracy was still inconsistent but overall productions were clearer, and child accepted feedback well.\n\n3) Auditory discrimination for /s/ vs no /s/\n- Used minimal pairs (sun/un, sip/ip, seat/eat) at a listening level. Child was asked to point to the picture that matched the clinician’s word.\n- Child correctly identified the target in more than half of opportunities, indicating emerging awareness of the presence/absence of /s/.\n- Required repetition of instructions and additional modeling of listening behavior, but showed good interest in the \"listening game.\"\n\n4) Final consonant awareness (CVC words)\n- Briefly revisited final /t/ and /p/ in simple words (hat, hot, up, cup) using simultaneous production.\n- Child was more willing to attempt full CVC words, though final consonants were still often omitted without cues.\n- With tapping cue, some accurate final consonant productions were observed, but this remains an emerging skill.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Given the notable improvement with /s/ in isolation and syllables, begin to systematically build consistency at the imitated word level for initial /s/.\n- Continue brief listening tasks for /s/ vs no /s/ to support phonological awareness.\n- Home practice: caregivers to continue modeling /s/ and can now encourage the child to say 3–5 simple /s/ syllables (\"see, soo, sah\") once or twice daily, praising effort rather than perfection."

            "note_text": "Parent/caregiver report:\nMom shared that she understands today's focus will be on speech sounds. She reported that at home he is \"hard to understand\" for unfamiliar people and often leaves off the ends of words (e.g., \"ca\" for car). She notices he uses lots of single words and some 2–3 word phrases.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned to the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from mom with reassurance. He engaged well in floor play once settled. Attention to adult-directed tasks was fair; he needed frequent redirection from self-directed play (cars, blocks) back to speech activities. He responded positively to visual supports and turn-taking games.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Baseline of overall speech sound production\n- Speech sample collected during play. Frequent final consonant deletion noted (e.g., /kɑ/ for car, /dɔ/ for dog), and some initial consonant substitutions (e.g., /t/ for /k/, /d/ for /g/). Intelligibility to the clinician was reduced in connected speech, though familiar play themes helped with guessing. Syllable shapes observed included CV, CVCV, and some CVC words, often missing final sounds.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Targeted /k/ in isolation using \"back sound\" cues and tongue depressor visuals. Client was able to approximate /k/ in isolation in about half of opportunities with maximal verbal and visual cueing. When attempting CV syllables (\"koo, kah\"), productions often shifted to /t/ (\"too, tah\"). He tolerated mirror work and placement cues but required consistent modeling.\n\n3. Final consonants (p, m, t) at imitated word level\n- Introduced final /p, m, t/ in simple CVC words (e.g., pop, mom, hat) in imitation. Client frequently omitted the final consonant or added a neutral vowel (\"pah-puh\"). A few successful productions with maximal segmentation (saying the word in two parts and tapping the final sound) were observed, but accuracy was low overall.\n\n4. Two-word phrases with clearer key words\n- Encouraged short phrases during play (e.g., \"more cars,\" \"big bus\"). Client used many single words and some 2-word combinations spontaneously. Speech clarity within phrases was similar to single-word level; no clear difference in accuracy but good willingness to attempt longer utterances.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\nContinue to build rapport and complete further baseline probing of key sounds (/k, g/, final consonants). Will focus on initial /k/ and final consonants at the imitated word level next session. Recommended that mom model clear final sounds in everyday routines (e.g., emphasizing /p/ in \"up\" and /t/ in \"out\") without asking him to repeat yet, to keep things positive."

She has not noticed big changes yet but feels he is \"trying to copy\" more often when she slows down.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient came into the room more easily today and joined the SLP at the table for short periods. He remained highly interested in cars and trains; these were incorporated into drill play. He was generally cooperative but needed breaks between structured tasks. Responded well to praise and visual tokens.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Reviewed /k/ in isolation using mirror and tongue-back cues. Compared with last week, he achieved more consistent \"back sound\" productions, with approximations in most attempts given maximal cues. Progressed to CV syllables (\"koo, key, kah\") in imitation. Accuracy was variable but there were several clearly correct productions, especially when the SLP segmented and slowed the model.\n\n2. Final /p, t, m/ at imitated word level\n- Practiced CVC words (pop, map, hat, hot, mom) using picture cards and toy items. He continued to omit many final consonants, but there were more attempts to \"add a sound at the end\" when cued to \"tap the last sound\" on the table. Needed maximal verbal and visual cues; emerging awareness of the final sound but not yet consistent.\n\n3. Syllable shapes (CVCV) for clarity\n- Used simple CVCV words (e.g., \"mama, dada, bunny, baby\") to support smoother production. Client was generally accurate with the syllable pattern, though individual consonants were sometimes distorted or substituted. Tapping each syllable helped him slow down. This was used as a warm-up and to support overall motor planning.\n\n4. Two-word phrases in play\n- Continued to encourage 2-word phrases such as \"more cars,\" \"blue car,\" \"my turn.\" Client imitated these combinations in many opportunities and produced a few spontaneously. Speech intelligibility within these phrases remained reduced but he showed increased willingness to imitate longer models.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\nGiven the noticeable increase in attempts and some clearer /k/ and final consonant productions with maximal support, next session will continue at the imitated word level for /k/ and final consonants, with more structured practice. Encouraged mom to keep modeling and to praise any efforts to add an ending sound, without correcting every attempt."

She still finds many words \"choppy\" or incomplete but feels he is \"trying more.\" No concerns with hearing or health this week.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient entered the room willingly and quickly engaged with a car garage toy. He accepted a mix of floor play and brief table-top work. Attention to tasks was better than previous sessions, with fewer redirections needed. He responded well to visual choices and short, predictable routines.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Initial /k/ at imitated word level\n- Moved from isolation/CV practice to initial /k/ in single words (car, key, cow, cookie, cat). With visual mouth cues and \"back sound\" reminders, he produced initial /k/ more consistently than previous sessions. Accuracy in imitation was noticeably higher, especially for high-interest words like \"car\" and \"cookie.\" Occasional fronting to /t/ still occurred, but he often attempted to self-correct when cued to \"try the back sound.\"\n\n2. Final /p, t, m/ at imitated word level\n- Continued CVC practice using picture cards and mini objects (cup, up, hat, hot, mom, home). Compared with last session, he showed a small increase in successful final consonant productions with maximal cueing (e.g., segmenting, tapping the last sound, visual cues). Accuracy remained inconsistent; he often reverted to leaving off the final sound without direct prompting.\n\n3. Early /s/ exploration in isolation\n- Briefly introduced /s/ as a \"quiet snake sound\" using a mirror and gesture. He was able to approximate a prolonged /s/ sound in some attempts when cued to keep his tongue behind his teeth. This was exploratory only; no word-level expectations yet.\n\n4. Functional phrases for requesting\n- Practiced short phrases during play (\"I want car,\" \"more bubbles,\" \"my turn\"). He imitated 2–3 word phrases reliably when models were short and paired with visuals. Speech clarity remained variable but there were a few clearer productions when he slowed down with the SLP.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\nContinue with initial /k/ at the imitated word level, aiming for greater consistency before moving to phrases. Maintain focus on final /p, t, m/ with strong visual and tactile cues. Home: mom to highlight words with /k/ at the beginning (car, cookie, key) and model slow, clear productions, inviting him to \"try the back sound\" for a few repetitions during play."

He participated well in structured games at the table and transitioned between activities with visual countdowns. Attention was good with brief movement breaks.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Initial /k/ in words and short carrier phrases\n- Practiced initial /k/ words (car, key, cow, cat, cookie, cup) in imitation. Accuracy at the word level was much more consistent today compared to earlier sessions, especially with a single verbal reminder to \"use your back sound.\" He required less intensive cueing. Began trialing simple carrier phrases (\"my car,\" \"big car,\" \"more cookie\") in imitation. At the phrase level, initial /k/ remained present in many attempts, though overall intelligibility was still mixed.\n\n2. Final /p, t, m/ in CVC words\n- Continued work on final consonants using picture cards and a \"sound train\" game. He produced final /p, t, m/ correctly in some imitated trials when given segmented models and visual tapping cues. There was a slight increase in consistency but he still frequently omitted the final consonant without direct support.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Further practice of /s/ as the \"quiet snake sound\". He was able to sustain /s/ in isolation for longer stretches when watching himself in the mirror. Introduced simple CV syllables (\"see, soo\") in imitation. Accuracy was emerging; he benefited from reminders to keep lips relaxed and tongue behind teeth.\n\n4. Functional 2–3 word phrases\n- Encouraged short phrases for commenting and requesting (\"more cars,\" \"I want bubbles,\" \"big truck\"). He imitated these with good willingness. Some spontaneous 2–3 word phrases were observed during play, though many were not fully intelligible.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\nGiven increasing consistency with initial /k/ at the word level and early success in carrier phrases, plan to continue practicing /k/ in both words and short phrases next session. Will maintain focus on final consonants with high visual support.

He was talkative and eager to participate in turn-taking games. Attention was generally good; he tolerated short sets of drill practice when interspersed with play.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Initial /k/ in carrier phrases and simple sentences\n- Focused on /k/ in short phrases and early sentences (\"my car go,\" \"I want cookie,\" \"cow is big\"). He produced initial /k/ accurately in many imitated phrases with only light verbal reminders. There were some spontaneous uses of clear /k/ in connected play (e.g., \"my car\" without a model). This reflects steady progress from primarily word-level success to more phrase-level use.\n\n2. Final /p, t, m/ in imitated words\n- Continued CVC word practice with a picture lotto game (cup, up, map, hat, hot, mom, home). He demonstrated a small but noticeable increase in the number of correct final consonants when cued to \"tap the last sound\" and listen carefully. However, omissions still occurred frequently, particularly when he was excited or speaking quickly.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation and simple syllables (\"see, soo, sa\"). He showed improved control of the airflow and placement compared to earlier sessions, with fewer substitutions or distortions. He required reminders to keep his tongue behind his teeth but was more successful in imitated syllables.\n\n4. Functional phrases for play\n- Encouraged use of short phrases to direct play (\"my turn,\" \"more bubbles,\" \"go fast,\" \"stop car\"). He imitated these readily and produced some independently. Speech clarity remained variable, but there were instances of clearer productions when he slowed down with the SLP’s support.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\nContinue to consolidate /k/ at the phrase level and monitor for more spontaneous use in play. Maintain focus on final consonants with strong visual and tactile cues, as this remains an area of need. Home: mom to continue practicing a small set of target words for final /p, t, m/ (e.g., up, cup, hat, mom) using tapping or clapping for the last sound, keeping expectations low and praise high."

He participated well in a mix of table-top and floor activities. Attention and cooperation were similar to last week; he benefited from visual schedules and frequent positive feedback.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Initial /k/ in phrases and short sentences\n- Continued practice of /k/ in short phrases/sentences (\"my car go,\" \"I want cookie,\" \"cow is big,\" \"kick the ball\"). Performance was similar to the previous session: generally accurate /k/ in imitation with light verbal cues, and some spontaneous correct productions in play. No major change in cueing needs or accuracy.\n\n2. Final /p, t, m/ in CVC words\n- Repeated CVC practice using a board game format. He produced some correct final consonants with maximal segmenting and tapping cues, but overall pattern remained one of frequent omission when supports were reduced. This appeared stable relative to last week.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and syllables\n- Reviewed /s/ in isolation and CV syllables (\"see, soo, say\"). Accuracy was comparable to the previous session: he could achieve a good \"quiet snake\" sound with cueing and produced several accurate syllables, but this has not yet generalized beyond structured imitation.\n\n4.

He transitioned smoothly and accepted both drill and play-based tasks. Attention and regulation were similar to prior sessions; he responded to turn-taking games and visual timers.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Initial /k/ in short sentences and play\n- Practiced /k/ in short sentences (\"the car is blue,\" \"I see a cow,\" \"kick the ball now\") using picture scenes and toys. Accuracy of initial /k/ remained good in imitation with light cues, similar to previous sessions. During free play, he produced several spontaneous /k/ words (e.g., \"car,\" \"cookie,\" \"cow\") with clear initial consonants, indicating stable carryover at this level.\n\n2. Final /p, t, m/ in imitated CVC words\n- Used a fishing game with picture cards to target final /p, t, m/.

Initial /k/ in varied word sets and short sentences\n- Expanded /k/ practice to include new words (e.g., kite, corn, coat) in addition to familiar ones. He maintained good accuracy for initial /k/ in imitation with minimal cues, and produced some spontaneous /k/ words during play. Overall performance was consistent with previous weeks.\n\n2. Final /p, t, m/ in CVC words with increased awareness\n- Targeted final consonants using a \"listening first\" approach: he listened to minimal pairs (e.g., \"ha\" vs \"hat\") and identified which sounded \"finished.\" He showed some understanding when listening, but his own productions remained largely characterized by omission of the final consonant unless strongly cued. Accuracy and cueing needs were similar to prior sessions.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Reviewed /s/ in isolation and CV syllables (\"see, say, soo\"). He could produce a fairly clear /s/ with verbal and visual cues. Accuracy remained stable, with no significant increase in independence.\n\n4.

He was able to produce a reasonable /s/ in many isolated attempts with visual and verbal cues. In words, accuracy was emerging but not yet consistent, with some productions sounding closer to /t/ or with reduced airflow.\n\n4. Functional phrases and sentences\n- Used picture supports to encourage 3–4 word sentences (\"the car is fast,\" \"I want more bubbles,\" \"look at the dog\"). He imitated these well and used similar structures spontaneously during play. Speech intelligibility is improved when he slows down and when key sounds (/k/) are produced accurately, though final consonant deletion continues to impact clarity.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\nSkills this week appear stable, with continued strong performance for /k/ and gradual, emerging awareness of final consonants and /s/ at the word level. Plan to maintain focus on final /p, t, m/ and to gradually increase practice of a small /s/ word set. Home: provided mom with simple visual cues for /s/ and a few picture cards to practice \"snake sound\" words for a few minutes daily."

            "note_text": "Parent/caregiver report:\nMom reported that he continues to do well with /k/ sounds and is beginning to point out when others \"forget\" an end sound during their listening games. She has heard a few clearer /s/ sounds in words like \"see\" when they practice together.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned smoothly and participated actively in both drill and play-based activities. Attention and cooperation were in line with recent sessions. He appeared proud when he noticed and corrected his own productions.\n\nGoals / therapy activities:\n1. Initial /k/ in conversation (maintenance)\n- Continued to monitor /k/ in spontaneous speech. He consistently produced accurate /k/ across a variety of words and contexts with no cueing required. This skill appears well generalized within the therapy environment and is being maintained.\n\n2. Final /p, t, m/ in CVC words\n- Practiced final /p, t, m/ using a picture-matching game and a \"finish the word\" routine. He produced some correct final consonants when given segmenting and tapping cues and occasionally self-corrected after a prompt (e.g., repeating \"ha\" as \"hat\"). However, omissions remained frequent without direct support. Overall performance was similar to the previous session.\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and initial /s/ words\n- Focused on /s/ in isolation and a small set of initial /s/ words (see, sun, soup, seat). He produced a clear /s/ in many isolated attempts with visual and verbal cues. In words, accuracy was emerging; he could achieve a close approximation in several trials but still needed significant support for tongue placement and airflow. This remains an early developing skill.\n\n4. Functional phrases and sentences\n- Used structured play to encourage 3–4 word sentences for describing and requesting (\"I see a cow,\" \"my car go fast,\" \"I want more bubbles\"). He imitated these structures easily and produced similar sentences independently. Intelligibility in these longer utterances is improving with accurate /k/ and occasional final consonant marking, but final consonant deletion and inconsistent /s/ continue to affect overall clarity.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\nSkills appear stable this week with solid maintenance of /k/ and ongoing, gradual work on final consonants and /s/. Plan to continue focusing on final /p, t, m/ and initial /s/ at the word level in upcoming sessions, while monitoring generalization to home. Home: encouraged mom to keep sessions short and fun, emphasizing listening for \"finished words\" and practicing a few \"snake sound\" (/s/) words each day."

            "note_text": "Parent/caregiver report:\n- Mother attended session. She reported that child is “hard to understand” for unfamiliar listeners and often leaves off sounds at the ends of words. No major changes since initial evaluation. Family is motivated to work on “clearer talking.”\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from caregiver with verbal reassurance and a preferred toy. Once seated at the table, child was curious and talkative. Attention was best during hands-on games and short activities; needed intermittent redirection when tasks became more structured.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Baseline probing in play-based picture naming and simple imitation tasks. Child frequently omitted final consonants (e.g., “bee” for “beat,” “boo” for “boom”). Occasional spontaneous correct final /m/ in familiar words (e.g., “mom”). In imitation, could add final /p/ or /t/ in isolated attempts with maximal verbal cueing (“stop your sound,” “tap at the end”) and visual cueing (pointing to mouth). Accuracy overall low and inconsistent.\n\n2. Initial /k/ production (word level, imitation)\n- Child showed fronting of /k/ to /t/ in spontaneous speech (e.g., “tar” for “car”). In structured imitation with mirror and tactile cues to “tongue back,” could produce /k/ in isolation in a few attempts. At word level (“car,” “key,” “cup”), accuracy was limited; productions often approximated /t/ or were distorted. Required maximal modeling, slow rate, and repeated practice.\n\n3. Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV) in play\n- Observed spontaneous use of CV and CVCV (same consonant) forms (e.g., “baba,” “mama,” “dada”) during play. Some CVCV alternating consonant forms present but less consistent. Clinician modeled clearer consonant targets within these syllable shapes. Child was interested in copying silly words but did not consistently maintain final sounds.\n\n4. Overall intelligibility in structured play\n- In familiar play routines, caregiver and clinician could generally understand child with contextual support. Without context, many utterances required repetition or clarification. Child did not appear frustrated and was willing to repeat when asked.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to establish baseline for final consonants and initial /k/ at the imitated word level.\n- Introduce simple visual cue (tapping a token) to mark final sounds.\n- Encourage parent to model slow, clear CVC words in routines (e.g., “cup,” “bed,” “map”) without pressuring child to repeat.\n- Next session: begin more systematic drill-play for final /p, t, m/ and initial /k/ with high support."

Child appeared eager and requested specific toys. Maintained attention well for short drill-play segments when paired with turn-taking games. Required occasional reminders to sit and wait for their turn but was generally cooperative.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, t, m/)\n- Targeted at the imitated word level using picture cards and a simple board game. With maximal verbal and visual cueing (pointing to mouth, hand cue to “stop” the word), child produced final /p/ correctly in several opportunities but continued to omit many final consonants overall. Some emerging correct final /m/ in imitation for high-frequency words (e.g., “mom,” “ham”). Accuracy remains low but there were more attempts to add an ending sound compared to baseline.\n\n2. Initial /k/ production (syllable and word level, imitation)\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation and in CV syllables (“koo,” “kay,” “kee”) using mirror and tongue-back cues. Child could imitate /k/ in isolation more reliably today with repeated models. At the word level (“car,” “key,” “cow”), accuracy remained inconsistent, with frequent substitution to /t/, but there were a few clearer /k/ productions when the clinician slowed the model and used tactile cues on the throat and jaw. Still requires maximal support.\n\n3. Syllable shapes and clarity in simple words\n- Child imitated a variety of CV and CVCV patterns in play (e.g., “baby,” “bunny,” “teddy”). Some approximations were less clear, but child was able to improve productions with immediate imitation. Final consonants often omitted in CVCV+CVC combinations (e.g., “teddy bear”).\n\n4. Early self-monitoring\n- Child demonstrated emerging awareness of sound differences when clinician contrasted words with and without final sounds (e.g., “bee” vs. “beat”). Child occasionally giggled and attempted to “fix” the word when clinician exaggerated the missing sound.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on final /p, t, m/ at the imitated CVC word level with high support.\n- Maintain intensive practice of /k/ in isolation and CV syllables, trial a limited set of /k/ words in highly structured contexts.\n- Encourage caregiver to model pairs like “bee/beat,” “boo/boot” during play, emphasizing the end sound but not forcing repetition.\n- Next session: build more consistent practice with a small set of functional CVC words (e.g., “cup,” “bed,” “map”)."

She feels some words are “a bit clearer” but still sees many omissions in spontaneous speech. No new concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered the room independently and quickly joined the activity. Very engaged with turn-taking games and sticker rewards. Tolerated brief structured practice between play turns. Needed minimal redirection; responded well to praise.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC: /p, t, m/; imitation)\n- Used a limited set of practice words (e.g., “cup, map, hat, feet, mom, ham”) in drill-play. With verbal and visual cueing, child showed improved consistency compared to last week. Many final /p/ and /m/ productions were accurate in imitation when cues were provided; final /t/ remained more variable. Child occasionally added a schwa (e.g., “cup-uh”) but could reduce this with modeling. Overall, accuracy and number of attempts increased, and child appeared more aware of the need for an ending sound.\n\n2. Initial /k/ (CV and CVC word level, imitation)\n- Practiced /k/ in CV syllables and then in a small set of words (e.g., “car, key, cow, cookie”). Child produced /k/ in isolation more consistently and could carry it into some CV syllables with moderate cueing. At word level, there were more emerging correct productions, especially in “car” and “key,” though /t/ substitutions still occurred frequently. Less physical cueing was needed compared to previous sessions.\n\n3. Final consonants in functional phrases (2-word combinations)\n- Introduced simple two-word phrases (e.g., “my cup,” “big map,” “red hat”) in imitation. Child generally produced the phrase structure but often dropped final consonants in spontaneous attempts. With direct modeling and a cue to “put the sound at the end,” child could add final /p/ or /m/ on some trials. Phrase-level work remains emerging.\n\n4. Intelligibility in structured play\n- During familiar play routines, child’s speech was slightly more understandable to clinician than in earlier sessions when final consonant cues were used. Without cues, intelligibility remained reduced, but there were more self-corrections after clinician prompted, “Did you put your end sound?”\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue targeting final /p, t, m/ at the word level, aiming to increase consistency and reduce extra vowel sounds.\n- Maintain initial /k/ practice in CV and CVC words; begin to fade some tactile cues where possible.\n- Encourage parent to use short, consistent practice lists (3–4 words) for final consonants in daily routines.\n- Next session: consider adding a simple visual cue chart for final sounds to support carryover into phrases."

No concerns about fatigue or behavior at home.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child was cheerful and cooperative. Transitioned smoothly and quickly engaged with the clinician. Sustained attention for longer drill-play segments than in previous weeks and willingly participated in structured tasks when paired with a game. Responded positively to specific feedback about their speech.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC: /p, t, m/; imitation and cued, early independence)\n- Continued with a focused set of CVC words and expanded slightly to new items. Child produced final /p/ and /m/ with moderate verbal cues (e.g., “stop your word,” “close your lips”) with noticeably higher consistency than last session. Final /t/ remained somewhat less stable but showed improved accuracy with a visual cue (touching the front of the mouth). In several familiar words, child produced final consonants with only a light reminder or independently within the game. Accuracy is improving and cueing demands are beginning to decrease.\n\n2. Initial /k/ (CVC words; imitation)\n- Practiced a small group of /k/ words (e.g., “car, key, cow, coat, cat”) using mirror and “tongue back” cues. Child produced /k/ correctly in many imitation trials, especially at the beginning of the session. Occasional reversion to /t/ persisted but child was more responsive to correction and could “fix” the word after a model. Overall, less intensive cueing was required, and production of /k/ in known words is becoming more consistent.\n\n3. Final consonants in short phrases (2–3-word phrases, imitation)\n- Targeted phrases like “my cup,” “big map,” “red hat,” and “two feet” at the imitated phrase level. Child was able to maintain the phrase structure and, with modeling plus a visual cue at the end, included final consonants on some trials. Still more accurate in single-word practice than in phrases, but there was evidence of early carryover when the same word was repeated in both contexts.\n\n4. Awareness and self-correction\n- When clinician exaggerated missing final sounds in contrast pairs (e.g., “bee” vs. “beat”), child demonstrated improved ability to identify the “finished” word and sometimes attempted to repair their own production. This suggests increasing awareness of sound structure.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue CVC final /p, t, m/ work at the word level, with gradual increase in independent productions and more phrase-level practice for familiar words.\n- Maintain /k/ at the imitated word level; begin to trial simple two-word combinations with /k/ words (e.g., “blue car”) in structured play.\n- Encourage parent to prompt self-correction using simple language such as “Did you finish your word?” and praise any attempts.\n- Next session: consider adding another final consonant (e.g., /n/) if current targets remain stable."

She still hears many omissions in longer or new words. No other changes noted.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child arrived in good spirits and transitioned easily. Remained engaged for structured activities with only brief breaks. Followed simple directions and responded well to praise and token rewards. Some mild silliness toward the end of session but easily redirected.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC: /p, t, m/; imitation and cued independence)\n- Continued focused practice on a mix of previously trained and new CVC words. Child maintained similar performance to last week, with good accuracy for final /p/ and /m/ in imitation and with moderate cues. Final /t/ was still less consistent but did not regress. Child showed a few spontaneous correct final consonants on familiar words during play. Skills appear to be consolidating at this level.\n\n2. Initial /k/ (CVC words; imitation)\n- Repeated practice with the same core /k/ word set. Child continued to show improved ability to imitate /k/ in words with moderate verbal and visual support. Accuracy was comparable to last session, with some variability related to attention. Fewer substitutions to /t/ overall, but still present. No major changes in cueing level needed.\n\n3. Final consonants in 2–3-word phrases (imitation)\n- Practiced short phrases such as “my cup,” “big map,” and “two feet” in structured play. Child was able to imitate phrases with the correct structure. Final consonants were produced accurately in some trials when strongly cued but were often omitted in less-supported attempts. Performance was similar to prior session, with no clear increase or decrease in consistency.\n\n4. General intelligibility in structured play\n- In the context of practiced words, clinician and caregiver could understand child more easily, especially when final consonant cues were provided. For unpracticed words, intelligibility remained reduced, requiring clarification. No signs of frustration; child was willing to repeat when asked.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue working at current levels to stabilize skills for final /p, t, m/ and initial /k/ at the word level.\n- Maintain phrase-level practice for a small set of familiar CVC words, focusing on consistent end sounds.\n- Encourage parent to keep using the same practice list at home and to praise any independent use of final sounds.\n- Next session: recheck readiness to increase phrase-level demands if word-level accuracy remains stable."

Final consonants in 2–3-word phrases (imitation)\n- Continued work on phrases such as “my cup,” “big hat,” “two feet,” and “blue car.” Child could imitate these phrases and include final consonants when fully supported with cues. When cues were faded, omissions remained frequent. Performance at this level remained similar to earlier sessions, indicating ongoing practice is required.\n\n4. Brief probe of longer phrases\n- Clinician briefly probed slightly longer phrases (e.g., “I see the cup,” “look at mom”) to gauge readiness. Child was able to imitate the phrase structure but typically omitted final consonants even with cues, indicating that current level remains appropriate.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on final consonant production in CVC words and short phrases, with attention to stabilizing final /t/.\n- Maintain /k/ practice at the imitated word level, with occasional probes into simple phrases.\n- Encourage caregiver to continue short, positive practice sessions and to highlight successful end sounds in natural conversation.\n- Next session: reassess phrase-level performance to monitor for any emerging readiness to increase complexity."

            "note_text": "Parent/caregiver report:\n- Mother reported that child continues to enjoy practicing and sometimes initiates using the practice pictures. She hears clear final sounds in some of the target words and short phrases but feels overall intelligibility has not changed significantly from recent weeks. No new concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child appeared comfortable and familiar with therapy routine. Participated well in structured tasks, especially when integrated into turn-taking games. Attention and cooperation were good throughout session.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC: /p, t, m/; word level)\n- Child’s performance on CVC words remained similar to prior weeks. Final /p/ and /m/ were generally accurate in imitation with moderate cues; final /t/ showed ongoing variability but no regression. A few spontaneous correct final consonants were again heard in familiar words during play. Skills appear stable, suggesting continued consolidation at this level.\n\n2. Initial /k/ (CVC words; imitation)\n- Practiced established /k/ word set. Child produced /k/ correctly in many imitated attempts with familiar cues. Occasional substitutions to /t/ persisted but were not increased. Overall performance and cueing needs mirrored previous sessions.\n\n3. Final consonants in 2–3-word phrases (imitation)\n- Continued phrase-level practice with targets such as “my cup,” “red hat,” “two feet,” and “blue car.” Child was able to include final consonants when given strong verbal and visual cues. With reduced cueing, omissions remained common. No notable shift in consistency compared to recent sessions.\n\n4. Intelligibility and self-monitoring\n- Within the structured tasks and familiar vocabulary, clinician understood child more easily, particularly when child attempted to apply final consonant strategies. Child showed occasional self-correction attempts after clinician prompts, reflecting stable but not markedly expanding awareness.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Maintain current targets for final consonant production and /k/ at the word level, with continued phrase-level practice using familiar words.\n- Encourage caregiver to continue daily short practice and to provide specific praise when child uses final sounds independently.\n- Next session: continue monitoring for subtle improvements in independence and consistency that may indicate readiness for progression."

She continues to hear clearer final sounds in some practiced words and short phrases, but this has not yet generalized widely. She is satisfied that child enjoys therapy and is willing to keep working on goals.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned easily, appeared relaxed, and engaged readily in both drill and play-based activities. Demonstrated good participation, followed directions, and responded positively to reinforcement. No behavioral concerns.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC: /p, t, m/; word level)\n- Reassessed a variety of CVC words. Child’s accuracy remained stable: final /p/ and /m/ were generally produced correctly in imitation with moderate cues, while final /t/ remained somewhat inconsistent. Several independent correct final consonants were again heard in familiar words during play. Skills are holding steady at this level with evidence of consolidation.\n\n2. Initial /k/ (CVC words; imitation)\n- Continued practice with established /k/ words. Child maintained prior accuracy, producing /k/ correctly in many imitation trials with familiar verbal and visual supports. Occasional fronting to /t/ persisted but did not increase. No major changes in cueing level were required.\n\n3. Final consonants in 2–3-word phrases (imitation)\n- Practiced phrases such as “my cup,” “big hat,” “two feet,” and “blue car.” Child could include final consonants when given strong cues; omissions were common when cues were faded. Performance was comparable to recent sessions, indicating that current phrase-level demands remain appropriate for ongoing practice.\n\n4. Intelligibility in structured play\n- Within the context of practiced words and phrases, clinician and caregiver were able to understand child more readily, particularly when final consonant strategies were used. In less-structured conversation, intelligibility remained reduced but stable compared to prior weeks.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue current intervention plan targeting final consonants in CVC words and short phrases, with a focus on increasing consistency and independence, especially for final /t/.\n- Maintain /k/ at the imitated word level with periodic probes into simple phrases.\n- Recommend ongoing home practice with a small, functional word list, emphasizing positive feedback for any independent use of final consonants.\n- Next block: consider formal progress review and potential adjustment of targets based on cumulative data and caregiver priorities."

Baseline for speech sound production\n- Informal play-based sample collected. Child produced mostly single words and short 2–3 word phrases.\n- Frequent final consonant deletion noted (e.g., \"boo\" for book, \"pi\" for pig).\n- Inconsistent production of /k/ and /g/ (often fronted to /t/ and /d/, e.g., \"tar\" for car).\n- Occasional difficulty with initial /s/ and /f/ (substitutions and omissions), though not formally targeted.\n\n2. Final consonant production (CVC words) – exploration\n- Introduced final /p, t, m/ in simple CVC words at the imitation level (e.g., \"map,\" \"cup,\" \"ham\").\n- Child was able to imitate final consonants in isolation with strong visual cues (tapping the last sound) in a few trials but tended to drop them when attempting the whole word.\n- Accuracy at the word level was low and inconsistent; heavy modeling and segmentation were needed.\n\n3. Initial /k/ – exploration in isolation and simple syllables\n- Practiced “back sound” /k/ in isolation with mirror and verbal cues (“tongue up and back”).\n- Child could approximate /k/ in isolation in some trials but often reverted to /t/.\n- When attempting CV syllables (\"koo,\" \"key\"), productions frequently sounded closer to /t/.\n\n4. Functional phrase use\n- Encouraged child to use short functional phrases (\"more please,\" \"my turn,\" \"help me\") during play.\n- Child often relied on single words or pointing; with modeling, was able to imitate 2–3 word phrases in most opportunities.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Begin structured work on final consonants and initial /k/ at the imitation level.\n- Parent encouraged to model slow, clear CVC words in play (e.g., \"cup,\" \"map,\" \"bed\"), emphasizing the last sound with light tapping.\n- Continue to support short functional phrases at home (e.g., “more bubbles,” “my turn”) with models and gentle prompts."

Final consonants in CVC words (imitation)\n- Targeted final /p, t, m/ in picture naming and play (e.g., \"cup,\" \"cat,\" \"ham,\" \"map\").\n- With direct imitation and visual cueing (pointing to the final sound), child produced final consonants more consistently than last session.\n- Still omitted final sounds in many spontaneous attempts, but was able to add them when reminded in several trials.\n\n2. Initial /k/ at isolation and syllable level\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation using mirror and verbal cues about “back sound.”\n- Child produced clearer /k/ in isolation today with moderate verbal and visual cues.\n- Attempted CV syllables (\"key,\" \"cow,\" \"car\") in imitation; accuracy remained inconsistent, with frequent /t/ substitutions, but there were several recognizable /k/ productions across the session.\n\n3. Early functional phrases (2–3 words)\n- Continued to encourage use of short phrases such as \"more bubbles,\" \"my turn,\" \"help me.\" \n- Child imitated 2-word phrases in many opportunities when given a direct model; occasionally produced 2-word combinations spontaneously during play (e.g., \"my car,\" \"more bubbles\").\n\n4. Observational monitoring of /s/ and /f/\n- During play, child sometimes substituted or omitted /s/ and /f/ in initial position (e.g., \"un\" for sun, \"ish\" for fish), but these were not formally drilled.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue working on final consonants and initial /k/ at the imitation level, as child is beginning to show more consistent approximations.\n- Parent encouraged to emphasize final sounds in everyday words and to praise any attempts.\n- Continue modeling short functional phrases and give child time to imitate before giving the item."

She notices many words are shortened (e.g., “do” for “dog”). No concerns with hearing or overall health.\n- Family is hoping to focus on clearer words before starting kindergarten next year.\n\nBehavior/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with some initial shyness but warmed up after a few minutes of play.\n- Attended well to activities for 5–7 minutes at a time with occasional redirection.\n- Responded well to visual supports and hands-on toys.\n\nTherapy goals and observations:\nGoal 1: Establish baseline for speech sound production\n- Informal play-based assessment and structured probes completed.\n- Noted consistent final consonant deletion in CVC words (e.g., “do_” for “dog,” “ca_” for “cat”).\n- Difficulty producing /k/ and /g/ in any word position; often substituted with /t/ and /d/ (e.g., “tar” for “car”).\n- /f/ and /s/ were inconsistently produced in initial position; sometimes omitted or replaced with stops.\n- Child tolerated imitation tasks but needed frequent models and repetition.\n\nGoal 2: Introduce final consonants at isolation/syllable level\n- Targeted simple final /p/ and /m/ in VC syllables (e.g., “up,” “um”) using visual cueing (picture of “sound at the end”) and tactile cue (touch to lips).\n- Able to imitate some VC syllables with maximum verbal and visual cues; productions were often approximations with reduced final consonant.\n- Child benefited from slowed speech and “whisper practice” to feel the ending sound.\n\nGoal 3: Introduce velar sound /k/ in isolation\n- Practiced “tongue back” position for /k/ using mirror and puppet.\n- Child produced approximations of /k/ in isolation with maximal support (simultaneous production with SLP, jaw support, and tongue-back cues). Accuracy low and inconsistent.\n- No carryover into syllables yet.\n\nGoal 4: Functional communication during play\n- Encouraged child to attempt single words to request toys (e.g., “ball,” “more,” “car”).\n- Child often relied on pointing and vocalizing; with models, could imitate several single words, though many were reduced or unclear.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to establish consistent production of final consonants in simple VC and CVC words and work on /k/ in isolation.\n- Provide parent with simple home practice ideas: emphasizing final sounds in play (e.g., “up, up, uP!”; “pop!” during bubbles), focusing on listening and gentle imitation, not correction.\n- Next session: probe specific target words for final /p/ and /m/ and continue shaping /k/ at isolation level."

Initial /s/ at word level (imitation)\n- Targeted initial /s/ in simple CVC words (e.g., sun, soup, sock) using picture cards.\n- In imitation, productions were inconsistent; /s/ was often substituted with /d/ or omitted (e.g., \"dun\" for sun, \"oup\" for soup).\n- With maximal verbal and visual cueing (\"long snake sound,\" finger in front of mouth), he achieved a few clear productions but needed frequent reminders.\n\n2. Final consonant production (final /p, t, m/ at word level)\n- Practiced final consonants in VC and CVC words in imitation (e.g., up, cup, cat, ham).\n- Tended to omit final sounds, especially in more exciting play contexts (e.g., \"cu\" for cup).\n- With simultaneous production and tapping cues, he occasionally marked the final consonant, but consistency remained low.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Introduced /f/ sound in isolation using mirror, visual cue for \"biting lip, blowing air.\"\n- Able to approximate /f/ in isolation intermittently with strong modeling; often produced /p/ or blew air without lip contact.\n- Attempted CV syllables (\"foo,\" \"fuh\") with limited success; required hand-over-hand cueing to position the lip.\n\n4. Syllable shape: CV and CVCV\n- Observed use of CV (e.g., \"moo,\" \"bee\") and reduplicated CVCV (e.g., \"mama,\" \"dada\") shapes during play.\n- When prompted to imitate alternating CVCV (e.g., \"bunny,\" \"teddy\"), tended to reduce to one syllable or repeat the same syllable (\"bu-bu\").\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue targeting initial /s/ and /f/ in isolation and imitated word level with strong visual and verbal cueing.\n- Maintain focus on marking final consonants /p, t, m/ in simple VC/CVC words.\n- Encourage parents to model clear final sounds during daily routines (e.g., \"up,\" \"in,\" \"cup\") and praise any attempts to add the final sound without requiring corrections for every error.\n- Next session: re-assess response to /s/ and /f/ cues; consider introducing simple /s/ in carrier phrase (\"my ___\") only if accuracy improves."

Initial /s/ at word level (imitation → emerging spontaneous)\n- Revisited initial /s/ in CVC words (sun, sock, soup, seat, soap) using pictures and a simple board game.\n- Accuracy in direct imitation improved compared to previous session; with visual cue for \"long snake sound,\" he produced clearer /s/ in roughly half of opportunities.\n- Started to attempt /s/ in more spontaneous play (\"see\" during peek-a-boo, \"so big\" with modeled phrase), though often reduced or distorted.\n\n2. Final consonant production (/p, t, m/ at word level)\n- Practiced final consonants in VC/CVC words (up, cup, cat, boat, home, ham) in imitation.\n- With verbal cueing and tapping the table for the \"end sound,\" he marked final consonants more frequently than last week, particularly final /p/ in \"up\" and \"cup.\"\n- Still inconsistent with final /t/, occasionally adding a vowel (\"ca-tuh\") or omitting it; required moderate cueing.\n\n3. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on /f/ in front of a mirror using visual cue of \"biting lip and blowing.\"\n- More frequent approximations of /f/ in isolation, though still variable; sometimes produced /h/ or /p/.\n- In CV syllables (\"foo,\" \"fee,\" \"fa\"), produced a recognizable /f/ at the start in some attempts when given slowed rate and modeling.\n\n4. Syllable shape: alternating CVCV\n- Practiced alternating CVCV words (e.g., bunny, puppy, teddy) during play.\n- Still tended to simplify to a single syllable but showed more attempts to add the second syllable when given a clapping cue.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue with initial /s/ and final consonants at the imitated word level, using visual and tactile cues for the \"end sound.\"\n- Maintain /f/ in isolation and CV syllables; consider probing simple /f/ words next session if consistency continues to improve.\n- Home practice: parent to model slow, clear productions of words like \"up,\" \"cup,\" \"sun,\" emphasizing the beginning and end sounds, and praise any attempts.\n- Next session: monitor whether initial /s/ productions remain more consistent and trial a few /s/ words in short, supported phrases (e.g., \"my sun\") if appropriate."

Initial /s/ at phrase level and early sentence structures\n- Targeted initial /s/ words (sun, soap, sock, soup, seal) within short phrases (\"my sock,\" \"I see sun,\" \"more soap\") using picture scenes.\n- Accuracy of /s/ in phrases was generally good with a brief model; fewer cues were needed compared to previous sessions.\n- Trialed simple sentence frames (\"I see ___,\" \"I want ___\"); he was able to maintain the /s/ in some sentence attempts when the frame was familiar, but accuracy decreased when adding more words.\n\n2. Final consonant production (/p, t, m/; phrase level trial)\n- Practiced final consonants in words (up, cup, cat, boat, home, ham, map) during a storybook and matching activity.\n- Final /p/ and /m/ were often present in imitated words and some spontaneous comments (e.g., \"go up\"), though not yet consistent.\n- Final /t/ showed emerging presence in phrases such as \"my cat\" with strong modeling and visual cueing; he still omitted it in less supported contexts.\n\n3. Initial /f/ at word and phrase level (increasing independence)\n- Continued /f/ words (fish, foot, fun, fan, food, four) in a fishing and counting game.\n- Initial /f/ in imitated words remained strong; he frequently produced a clear /f/ with minimal cues and occasional self-correction.\n- In short phrases (\"my fish,\" \"big foot,\" \"four fish\"), he was able to maintain /f/ in many attempts, though accuracy decreased when speaking rapidly or combining multiple targets.\n\n4. Probe: /s/ blends in imitation (word level)\n- Briefly introduced simple /s/ blends (star, spoon, stop) in direct imitation.\n- Tended to omit the /s/ (e.g., \"tar\" for star) or reduce the cluster; required maximal modeling and segmentation (\"s\" + \"tar\").\n- This was treated as a probe only; not yet ready to target blends more intensively.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on initial /s/ and /f/ within short phrases and simple sentence frames, maintaining high success and confidence.\n- Maintain practice for final /p, t, m/ in both single words and supported phrases.\n- Home practice: encourage simple patterned sentences (\"I see sun,\" \"I want soup,\" \"my fish\") using picture books, praising effort and not over-correcting.\n- Next session: reinforce current targets at the phrase level and briefly re-probe /s/ blends as appropriate."

Once in the room, they engaged well in play-based activities and responded to visual reinforcers. Attention was variable; needed occasional breaks and redirection back to tasks.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final consonant production in CVC words (p, m, t)\n- Introduced final /p, m, t/ at the imitated word level (e.g., \"cup, map, mat, mop\"). Child was more successful in simultaneous productions with the clinician than in delayed imitation. Final consonants were often omitted or reduced to a neutral vowel. Some success with tapping the table to mark the last sound.\n\n2) Initial /k/ in syllables and simple words\n- Targeted /k/ in isolation and CV syllables (\"ku, ki, ko\") using a \"back sound\" cue and mirror. Accuracy in isolation was inconsistent; child frequently substituted /t/ (e.g., \"tea\" for \"key\"). Limited success at word level with maximal verbal and visual cueing.\n\n3) Syllable shapes (CV and CVCV)\n- Practiced simple CV and reduplicated CVCV syllables (\"moo, bee, mama, baby\") during play. Child produced CV shapes readily; CVCV shapes were often reduced to a single syllable or vowel-only productions. With modeling and slowed rate, child could imitate some clearer CVCV words.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to target final consonants in CVC words with high-frequency items and strong visual cues.\n- Maintain focus on establishing /k/ in isolation and simple syllables before expecting consistent word-level use.\n- Encourage caregivers to model slow, clear CVC words at home (e.g., \"map, cup, bed\") and to gently emphasize the last sound without pressuring the child to repeat each time."

They reported that child is “hard to understand” for unfamiliar listeners and that family often has to guess based on context. No major changes since the evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned with some hesitation but separated from caregiver with brief reassurance. Once in the room, they engaged well in play-based activities and responded positively to praise and turn-taking games. Attention was best with hands-on toys and brief activities.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Establish production of /k/ in isolation and simple syllables (back sound vs. front sound)\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation using mirrors, tongue “back sound” description, and visual of a “cough” sound. Child could approximate /k/ in isolation intermittently with maximal verbal and visual cueing (often substituted /t/). \n- In CV syllables (e.g., “koo, kah”), productions were largely fronted to /t/ with occasional close approximations when cued to “lift the back of your tongue.” Accuracy low and inconsistent.\n\n2) Initial /k/ at the imitated word level\n- Trialed a small set of words (e.g., “key, car, cow”) in imitation. Child typically produced /t/ in place of /k/ (e.g., “tea” for “key”). With simultaneous production and direct placement cues, a few clearer /k/ productions were observed but not yet consistent.\n\n3) Establish production of /s/ in isolation\n- Introduced “snake sound” /s/ with mirror and visual of teeth together/air through. Child was interested in the snake theme but often produced /d/ or a short “th” sound instead. With maximal model and gestural cues, child produced a prolonged /s/ a few times but could not yet maintain the posture independently.\n\n4) Functional word attempts in play\n- Encouraged child to imitate simple, functional words during play (e.g., “go, up, more, ball”). Child imitated several single words, though many were reduced or unclear. Focus was on building willingness to imitate and shaping clearer consonants with high praise.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue targeting /k/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables with heavy modeling and visual supports. Maintain short, play-based trials.\n- Caregiver coached to model “back sound” /k/ in a mirror at home using fun “cough” or “car” sounds, without pressuring for perfect accuracy.\n- Next session: re-check /k/ and /s/ in isolation; consider introducing final /k/ in simple words if any consistent back sound emerges."

Good participation with structured play (cars, animals). Some distractibility with extra toys on the table; responded to gentle redirection and clear expectations.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Reviewed “back sound” /k/ with mirror. Child produced a clearer /k/ in isolation more frequently today when given a strong model and verbal cue (“back sound”). Still required maximal cueing, but approximations were more consistent than last session.\n- In CV syllables (e.g., “koo, kah”), child produced mixed /k/ and /t/ responses. A few accurate CV productions were observed with slow pacing and segmented practice, suggesting emerging control.\n\n2) Initial /k/ at imitated word level\n- Practiced a small set of initial /k/ words (“key, car, cow, cookie”) with imitation. Child continued to front many productions to /t/; however, there were several instances where a clear /k/ was heard at the beginning of the word with heavy cueing and use of the mirror. Accuracy remains low but slightly improved from last week.\n\n3) /s/ in isolation\n- Re-introduced “snake sound.” Child was more willing to watch the clinician’s mouth and use the mirror. With direct instruction (teeth together, long air), child could briefly sustain a reasonable /s/ in several trials, though still inconsistent and often reverting to /d/ or a short “th.”\n\n4) Functional single-word imitation in play\n- Continued to encourage imitation of simple, functional words in play (e.g., “go, off, in, out, more, up”). Child imitated a variety of words with moderate success. Many productions remained imprecise, but willingness to attempt was good. Occasional self-corrections were observed when given a second model.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on building consistent /k/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables. Progress appears to be emerging but not yet ready to move up levels.\n- Caregiver encouraged to play “car” and “cookie” games at home, modeling strong /k/ and praising any attempts.\n- Next session: continue with current targets; if /k/ becomes more consistent, trial final /k/ in VC (e.g., “back”) in imitation."

Child was able to hold a reasonably clear /s/ in multiple trials with moderate cues.\n- Introduced simple syllables (e.g., “see, soo”) in imitation. Child often distorted the consonant, but there were a few productions where /s/ was audible at the beginning, indicating early progress into syllable-level practice.\n\n4) Functional word and short phrase imitation\n- Encouraged child to imitate short functional words and 2-word phrases (e.g., “more cars,” “my turn,” “go car”). Child imitated many attempts, with variable clarity. Some phrases containing initial /k/ showed clearer consonant production than in previous sessions.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen initial /k/ at the word level and support emerging spontaneous use in play.

Performance comparable to prior weeks, suggesting ongoing consolidation rather than new gains.\n\n3) Introduce /s/ in initial word position (early exploration)\n- Briefly trialed initial /s/ words (e.g., “sun, soup”) in imitation after reviewing isolation. Child’s productions were often distorted or substituted, but a few attempts showed an initial hiss-like sound. This was exploratory and not yet a main goal.\n\n4) Functional phrase practice in play\n- Used play routines to encourage short phrases (“my car,” “more bubbles,” “go up”). Child imitated many phrases; clarity remained higher for phrases containing familiar /k/ words and lower for others.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Skills this week remained generally stable with small, gradual improvements. Continue consolidating final /k/ and building phrase use.\n- Maintain brief /s/ word-level exploration as tolerated, without pressure for accuracy.\n- Caregiver encouraged to keep practicing a few words like “back, book” at home, emphasizing the final sound by gently tapping the table on the last sound.\n- Next session: continue current targets; if child shows more consistent final /k/, consider expanding to additional CVC words."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\n- Caregiver shared that over the past week, child started saying short phrases like “my car” and “more cookie” more independently, and these are easier to understand. They also noticed a stronger ending on words like “back” a few times.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child arrived in good spirits and was eager to show off speech to clinician (“my car!”). Participated well in both table-top and floor activities. Needed occasional prompts to stay on task but overall engagement was strong.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Initial /k/ in words and short phrases – increased independence\n- Practiced a larger variety of initial /k/ words and phrases (e.g., “car, cookie, cup, coat, key,” “my car,” “big cookie,” “blue cup,” “coat on”). Child produced initial /k/ accurately in most imitated trials with minimal cues.\n- Notably, child began to use several of these phrases spontaneously in play (e.g., “my car,” “more cookie,” “cup please”) with generally clear /k/ sounds. Less need for direct prompting compared to previous sessions, indicating meaningful progress in independence.\n\n2) Final /k/ in VC and CVC words – improved accuracy\n- Practiced “back, book, duck, bike, cake, rock.” With modeling and brief segmentation, child produced clearer final /k/ in many trials. While not perfect, there was a noticeable increase in the number of words with an audible final consonant.\n- Child responded well to visual cues (e.g., tapping the table for the last sound) and began to anticipate the final sound in some words without full segmentation.\n\n3) /s/ in isolation and simple syllables\n- Continued work on sustained /s/ and simple syllables (“see, soo, sah”). Child produced a more stable /s/ in several attempts with moderate cues and showed improved ability to start syllables with a brief /s/ before the vowel.\n- Still variable, but overall quality and control of the sound were better than earlier sessions.\n\n4) Functional 2–3 word phrase use in play\n- Built on child’s interest in cars and kitchen toys to elicit short phrases (e.g., “more blue car,” “I want cookie,” “go fast car”). Child imitated these phrases with improved clarity, particularly for known /k/ words. Some spontaneous 2–3 word phrases emerged without direct modeling.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Given the moderate, meaningful improvement in independence with /k/ at the word/phrase level and better final /k/, plan to continue practicing /k/ in short phrases and begin to gently incorporate it into simple sentence-like structures.\n- Maintain /s/ at isolation and syllable level while monitoring readiness for more consistent word-level practice.\n- Caregiver encouraged to model and praise short phrases such as “my car,” “more cookie,” and “back up” at home, focusing on clear beginning and ending sounds.\n- Next session: expand /k/ phrase work and begin simple sentence frames (e.g., “I see __,” “I want __”) with /k/ words."

She noted that he \"drops sounds\" at the ends of words and sometimes says \"t\" for \"k\". No major changes since the initial evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned to the therapy room with some hesitation but separated from Mom with reassurance. He was curious about the toys and engaged well in play-based activities. Attention was variable but generally adequate for short, structured tasks with frequent breaks.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Establish /k/ in isolation\n- Targeted /k/ in isolation using tongue-back cues and visuals (\"cough sound in the back\"). Client was able to approximate /k/ with moderate to maximal verbal and visual cueing, with inconsistent accuracy. Often substituted /t/ for /k/. Continued need for simultaneous productions with SLP.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in CV syllables (e.g., \"koo,\" \"kee\")\n- Practiced initial /k/ in simple CV syllables at the imitation level. Accuracy was low and productions frequently shifted to /t/. Client benefited from mirror work and hand cue to signal \"back sound.\" Able to produce a few accurate exemplars with high support.\n\n3. Final consonant production in CVC words (p, m, t)\n- Introduced final consonant marking at the imitated word level with visuals (e.g., \"map,\" \"mat,\" \"mom\"). Client frequently omitted final sounds, though he occasionally marked them when provided with slowed speech and segmenting. Some success with final /m/ in high-interest words (\"mom\").\n\n4. Functional phrase use\n- Encouraged short, functional phrases in play (e.g., \"my turn,\" \"more cars\"). Client mostly used 1–2 word utterances spontaneously and imitated simple 2-word combinations with models.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue to focus on establishing /k/ in isolation and CV syllables with high levels of support. Maintain work on final consonant marking for a small set of familiar words. Caregiver encouraged to model clear final sounds in daily routines (e.g., emphasizing end sounds in \"up,\" \"in,\" \"out\")."

He participated well in turn-taking games and responded to visual schedules. Attention was adequate with brief movement breaks.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued work on /k/ in isolation using mirror, tongue-back cues, and tactile prompts to the throat. Accuracy improved compared to last session; he produced a clearer /k/ in isolation in a number of trials with moderate cueing. When moving to CV syllables (\"koo,\" \"kah\"), accuracy was emerging but still inconsistent, with frequent /t/ substitutions.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in high-interest words\n- Introduced a small set of familiar /k/-initial words at the imitated word level (e.g., \"car,\" \"key,\" \"cow\"). Client was able to approximate /k/ in some trials when provided with a strong model and cue to \"make the back sound,\" though consistency was limited.

Attention to structured tasks was improved; he was able to remain at the table for slightly longer periods with minimal redirection.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Initial /k/ in imitated and cued words\n- Client showed a meaningful increase in consistency for initial /k/ in his core word list (\"car,\" \"key,\" \"cow,\" \"cup,\" \"coat\"). With a model and a brief cue, he produced /k/ correctly in most trials. Occasional /t/ substitutions occurred, but he demonstrated more frequent self-correction when provided with a questioning look or \"try again\" cue.\n\n2. Expansion of /k/ to additional words and simple phrases\n- Introduced new /k/-initial words (\"cake,\" \"cat,\" \"corn\") at the imitated word level. Accuracy was variable but better than in earlier sessions, with clearer /k/ in several attempts. Trialed short phrases (\"my car,\" \"big cake\") with direct models; client imitated these with moderate success, maintaining the /k/ in many productions.\n\n3. Final consonants (p, m, t) in CVC words\n- Continued work on final consonant marking. Client showed increased awareness of final sounds, occasionally pausing and adding the last sound after a cue. Final /m/ and /p/ were more consistent in a handful of practiced words (e.g., \"map,\" \"mom,\" \"cup\"). Final /t/ still required significant cueing and often reduced to a softer or omitted ending.\n\n4. Intelligibility in short phrases\n- Practiced 2–3 word functional phrases (\"my turn,\" \"more bubbles,\" \"go car\") during play, emphasizing clear initial and final sounds. Client imitated many of these with improved clarity compared to prior sessions, though spontaneous phrases remained less precise.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nGiven the moderate gains with initial /k/, will continue to expand the word set and increase practice in short carrier phrases. Maintain focus on final consonants, particularly /t/, using slow, segmented models.

Final consonant production (p, m, t) in CVC words\n- Revisited final consonants using a small set of picture cards and a \"tap the last sound\" strategy. Performance was similar to the previous session: final /m/ and /p/ were marked more consistently in practiced words, while final /t/ continued to be challenging and often omitted. He responded to slow, segmented practice but had difficulty carrying this over into more spontaneous speech.\n\n4. Intelligibility in play-based phrases\n- Encouraged 2–3 word requests and comments during play. Client produced many short phrases spontaneously, though speech clarity varied. With modeling, he was able to repeat phrases more clearly, particularly when focused on one or two target words.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue to consolidate gains with initial /k/ across a growing word set, maintaining practice in short carrier phrases. Keep targeting final consonants, with specific attention to /t/, while recognizing that progress here is more gradual.

End sounds remain inconsistent, though she occasionally hears a clearer \"p\" at the end of words like \"cup\" when she slows him down.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient was in a playful mood and initially preferred self-directed play. With gentle prompts and use of a visual schedule, he joined structured tasks. His participation improved when activities were embedded in games and he could earn small rewards.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Initial /k/ in mixed word set\n- Continued work with a mix of familiar and newer /k/-initial words. Accuracy and cueing needs were similar to previous sessions. He produced many correct /k/ sounds in known words when given a model, but consistency decreased in less familiar words or faster speech.\n\n2. /k/ in carrier phrases and short sentences\n- Practiced phrases and short sentences incorporating /k/ (e.g., \"I see a car,\" \"big cookie,\" \"the cat is up\"). Client imitated these with moderate accuracy; /k/ was often present but some distortions or substitutions persisted. Performance was comparable to last week, indicating ongoing consolidation at this level.\n\n3. Final consonants (p, m, t) in CVC words\n- Repeated structured practice with final consonants using segmenting and visual cues. Client maintained similar accuracy patterns: stronger for final /m/ and /p/, limited for final /t/. He tolerated the activities but did not yet show a notable jump in independence.\n\n4. Overall intelligibility in structured play\n- During play, the clinician modeled and recast his phrases with clearer sounds. Client occasionally attempted to copy these improved versions, but spontaneous productions remained less precise. Intelligibility with the clinician in this context was similar to recent sessions.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nContinue at the current level, allowing more time for consolidation of /k/ at the word and phrase levels and final consonant production in a small set of words. Caregiver encouraged to keep practice light and positive, focusing on a few key words (e.g., \"car,\" \"cup,\" \"cat\") and 2–3 CVC words for final sounds."

She feels more aware of his patterns and is trying to give him chances to try again without making him frustrated.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient separated easily and was cooperative overall. He showed good engagement with familiar games and tolerated short periods of more structured drill when interspersed with play. Attention and regulation were consistent with previous sessions.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Initial /k/ in varied words and simple phrases\n- Practiced /k/-initial words in a variety of contexts (naming pictures, in play, and in short phrases). Accuracy and cueing needs were similar to recent sessions: strong in a small group of well-practiced words, more variable in newer or less salient words. He continued to require moderate cueing to maintain consistency.\n\n2. /k/ in short sentences during play\n- Used play scenes (e.g., farm, kitchen) to elicit short sentences with /k/ (\"the cow is big,\" \"cook the cake\"). Client imitated these sentences fairly well with a model but had difficulty carrying over the same clarity into spontaneous comments.\n\n3. Final consonants in CVC words\n- Continued practice with final /m/, /p/, and /t/ in a small set of words. Accuracy remained stable: he produced clearer final /m/ and /p/ in drill and occasionally in short phrases, but final /t/ was still often omitted. He responded to slowed speech and tapping cues but needed consistent support.\n\n4. Functional communication with focus on clarity\n- Encouraged him to use short, clear phrases to request, protest, and comment. The clinician selectively focused on a few target words each activity, providing feedback and models. Overall intelligibility in these supported contexts remained similar to last week.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nMaintain the current focus on consolidating /k/ at word and phrase levels and reinforcing final consonants in a limited set of words. Plan to monitor for readiness to increase complexity once accuracy becomes more consistent. Caregiver encouraged to keep practice short and playful, emphasizing a few high-frequency /k/ words and final-consonant words at home."

He was eager to show the clinician what he could do and responded well to praise. He sustained attention for longer stretches of structured practice than in earlier sessions and appeared motivated by opportunities to \"beat his score\" or earn turns in games.\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. Initial /k/ in mixed words with reduced cueing\n- Targeted a wide range of /k/-initial words, including less familiar vocabulary. Client demonstrated a noticeable increase in consistency, especially when given only a brief verbal reminder rather than full visual cueing. He produced many correct /k/ sounds in both practiced and newer words, and he independently self-corrected in several instances after an inaccurate attempt.\n\n2. /k/ in phrases and short sentences (imitation and emerging spontaneous use)\n- Practiced short sentences containing /k/ (e.g., \"the car is fast,\" \"I want a cookie,\" \"the cat is on top\"). Client imitated these with improved clarity and required fewer repetitions to achieve accurate productions. In play, he began to use clearer /k/ sounds spontaneously in some of these words without direct prompting, suggesting emerging generalization.\n\n3. Final consonants (p, m, t) in CVC words and short phrases\n- Revisited final consonants, focusing on a core set of words (\"cup,\" \"cap,\" \"map,\" \"mom,\" \"hat,\" \"hot\"). Client showed slightly improved consistency, particularly for final /p/ and /m/ in both single words and short phrases (\"my cup,\" \"big map\"). Final /t/ remained the least consistent but was produced accurately in more imitated trials than before when provided with segmenting and tapping.\n\n4. Overall intelligibility in structured conversation\n- Engaged client in short, play-based conversations while emphasizing target words. His intelligibility to the clinician improved relative to prior sessions, especially when he slowed down and applied strategies practiced in drill.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nGiven the emerging independence with /k/ at the word level and improved accuracy in phrases, will continue to build sentence-level practice and encourage more spontaneous use of /k/ in play. Will maintain targeted work on final consonants, with ongoing emphasis on /t/. Caregiver encouraged to highlight and praise self-corrections and to gradually reduce cues as he becomes more consistent."

No new concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nClient transitioned easily and was enthusiastic about participating. He demonstrated good stamina for both table-top and floor-based activities. He responded positively to feedback and seemed proud when he produced words \"the grown-up way.\"\n\nGoals / therapy focus:\n1. /k/ in sentences and simple conversation\n- Focused on integrating /k/-initial words into longer sentences (e.g., \"the big car is going fast,\" \"I am cooking the cake\"). Client imitated these sentences with good accuracy and required only minimal cues for /k/. In short, supported conversations, he produced /k/ correctly in many familiar words without prompting, although occasional /t/ substitutions still occurred in less familiar contexts.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in spontaneous play\n- During open-ended play (cars, kitchen set), the clinician modeled and then stepped back to observe his spontaneous productions. Client independently used several clear /k/ words (\"car,\" \"cookie,\" \"coat\") and at times corrected himself when he heard an error. Overall, his /k/ use in spontaneous speech appeared more consistent than in earlier sessions, though not yet fully generalized.\n\n3. Final consonants (p, m, t) in CVC words and short phrases\n- Continued targeted practice with final consonants in a small set of words and short phrases. Performance was similar to last week: better consistency with final /p/ and /m/, with /t/ remaining more challenging. He benefited from segmenting and tactile cues and could often produce a clear final /t/ in imitation, but this did not consistently carry over into spontaneous speech.\n\n4. Clarity of 3–4 word phrases\n- Worked on 3–4 word functional phrases that combined his target sounds (e.g., \"I want my cup,\" \"put it on top,\" \"my big map\"). Client imitated these phrases with improving clarity, though some final consonants were still reduced or omitted.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\nMaintain emphasis on using /k/ accurately in sentences and spontaneous play while continuing direct work on final consonants, especially /t/. Plan to monitor for readiness to shift more focus to other sound patterns once /k/ is more consistently generalized. Caregiver encouraged to model slightly longer sentences with clear target sounds and to continue praising his self-corrections."

Attention was variable; needed occasional redirection from self-directed play back to speech tasks, but responded to visual supports and turn-taking games.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Final consonant production (CVC words: /p, m, t/)\n- Targeted final consonants in simple words (e.g., pop, map, hat, cup) at the imitated word level.\n- Child frequently omitted the final consonant or reduced it to a very weak production.\n- With maximal verbal cues (“keep your sound at the end”) and visual cues (pointing to picture edges), child produced clear final consonants in approximately half of opportunities.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in syllables and single words\n- Practiced /k/ in isolation and CV syllables (e.g., “kuh,” “kee,” “kah”).\n- Child tended to substitute /t/ for /k/ (“tea” for “key”).\n- With tongue-back cueing (“tongue tip down, back sound”) and mirror work, child could imitate /k/ in isolation inconsistently and in a few CV syllables.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in single words\n- Targeted initial /s/ at the imitated word level (sun, sock, soup, seat).\n- Child often substituted /d/ or omitted the sound entirely.\n- When watching clinician’s mouth and using a “snake sound” visual, child produced a few accurate /s/ in isolation; word-level accuracy remained low.\n\n4. Syllable shape production (CV, CVCV)\n- Observed syllable structures during play-based naming tasks.\n- Child produced CV and CVCV (same consonant) forms reliably (e.g., “mama,” “baba”) but tended to simplify more complex forms.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Continue weekly therapy focusing on final consonants and initial /k/ and /s/ in simple words.\n- Encourage slow, clear speech at home using short word lists (e.g., “pop, map, hat”) and praise any attempts to include the ending sound.\n- Next session: further probe final consonants and determine most stimulable sounds to build initial target set."

Functional communication and self-monitoring\n- Child attempted several 3–4 word utterances during play (e.g., “I want more bubbles,” “my car fall down”).\n- When clinician provided a gentle reminder to “say it slowly,” child was sometimes able to improve clarity, though not yet consistently.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- This week appears to be a consolidation period with skills generally stable compared to the previous session.\n- Continue current goals to allow further practice and stabilization at phrase level before increasing complexity.\n- Encourage home practice using short, predictable phrases with a few target words, focusing on slow rate and clear endings.\n- Next session: reassess phrase-level consistency and consider light introduction of simple sentence frames for the most solid targets if appropriate."

            "note_text": "Parent report:\nMom reports no major changes this week. She notes that child still does best with familiar, practiced words, and that clarity decreases when child is excited or talking about new topics. She has been continuing the picture card practice at home.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nChild transitioned without difficulty but was somewhat more active and silly today. Needed a few extra prompts to stay seated during table tasks, though responded well when activities were made more game-like. Still cooperative overall and enjoyed praise and stickers.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words/phrases\n- Targeted final /p, m, t, n/ in a similar set of words and phrases as prior sessions.\n- Accuracy remained comparable to last week; strong for a core group of familiar words, more variable for new items.\n- Continued to require moderate cueing (visual and verbal) to consistently mark final sounds in phrases.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in words and short phrases\n- Practiced /k/ in words and two-word phrases within a farm play routine.\n- Performance was similar to prior session: good accuracy in imitated words when focused, with reduced accuracy in less structured play.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words/phrases\n- Reviewed /s/ initial words using the “snake sound” visual and mirror.\n- Child continued to show a mix of correct and incorrect productions, with no clear change in overall pattern.\n\n4. Overall intelligibility in structured play\n- Child produced a variety of 2–4 word phrases spontaneously during play.\n- Listener understanding was mixed; familiar context and clinician knowledge supported comprehension.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Skills appear relatively stable, suggesting a plateau/consolidation week.\n- Maintain current targets and continue to provide intensive practice at the phrase level.\n- Encourage mom to keep sessions short and positive at home, focusing on success with known words rather than pushing many new items.\n- Next session: consider introducing a small number of new words within existing patterns to promote generalization while monitoring for readiness to increase to simple sentence frames."

Daycare staff have mentioned that they are understanding child a bit more easily in familiar routines.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\nChild entered session in a positive mood and was highly engaged. Tolerated longer stretches of structured practice with minimal breaks. Demonstrated increased willingness to try new words and appeared proud when receiving specific praise for “using all your sounds.”\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Final consonants in CVC words, phrases, and simple sentences\n- Expanded work from phrases to short, structured sentences for well-established words (e.g., “I see cup,” “I pop it,” “I like mom”).\n- Child produced final consonants with good consistency in imitated phrases and showed emerging accuracy in short sentences.\n- Required fewer visual cues; often a verbal reminder about “end sound” was enough.\n\n2. Initial /k/ in words and short sentences\n- Practiced /k/ words within simple sentence frames (e.g., “I see car,” “big cat jump”).\n- Compared to previous weeks, child maintained /k/ more consistently in both imitated words and structured sentences.\n- Occasional substitutions to /t/ still occurred, particularly in spontaneous comments, but there was a noticeable increase in correct productions even without intensive shaping.\n\n3. Initial /s/ in words and phrases\n- Continued targeting /s/ initial words in imitation and short phrases (e.g., “see sun,” “my soap”).\n- Child produced more accurate /s/ sounds with reduced need for mirror and tongue placement cues.\n- Began to self-correct on a few trials after hearing their own error, repeating the word with a clearer /s/.\n\n4. Functional intelligibility\n- In play, child used multiple 3–4 word utterances. With occasional reminders to “talk slowly,” many of these were more intelligible to the clinician.\n- There were more instances where child could be understood without relying solely on context.\n\nPlan/Recommendations:\n- Given the meaningful gains, continue to build sentence-level practice for final consonants and /k/ in a controlled set of words.\n- For home, provide simple sentence frames (e.g., “I see ___,” “I want ___”) using familiar target words and encourage mom to model and then fade prompts.\n- Next session: maintain sentence-level work for solid targets and further strengthen /s/ at the phrase level, beginning to probe sentence use for the most consistent /s/ words."

Noted that words like \"sun,\" \"soap,\" and \"fish\" are often unclear. No concerns with hearing or overall health this week.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with brief hesitation, then engaged well with toys once seated. Needed some warm-up time but participated in structured play for short intervals. Responded to visual supports and enjoyed turn-taking games.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Baseline for initial /s/ at word level (imitation)\n- Probed initial /s/ in single words (e.g., sun, sock, soup, see, sit) primarily in imitation. Productions were highly inconsistent; frequent substitutions included /d/ and /z/ (e.g., \"dun\" for sun, \"zock\" for sock). Child benefited from visual cue to show “smile teeth” and gentle verbal reminders to keep the tongue behind the teeth. Accuracy was low overall, but child attempted most items when supported.\n\n2. Baseline for initial /f/ at word level (imitation)\n- Assessed initial /f/ in words (e.g., fish, fan, five, foot). Child tended to stop /f/ to /p/ (\"pish\" for fish) or used /h/ (\"hish\"). Brief instruction on “bite your lip and blow” helped the child approximate /f/ in isolation with significant effort and modeling. Limited carryover into words; productions remained mostly inaccurate without maximal cues.\n\n3. Baseline for /s/ blends (imitation in play)\n- Introduced simple /s/ blends at the imitated word level in play (e.g., spill, stop, spin). Child often omitted the /s/ (\"pill,\" \"top,\" \"pin\"). Required direct models and simultaneous production with the clinician. Very few clear productions; this target is emerging and will remain at the imitated word level.\n\n4. Overall speech sound profile\n- During free play and conversation, child used many single words and short phrases, but overall intelligibility was reduced, especially with unfamiliar listeners. Occasional final consonants were omitted (e.g., \"ca\" for cat), though not consistently. Parent was able to understand most of child’s speech with contextual support.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to build rapport and gather additional baseline data for /s/, /f/, and /s/ blends.\n- Begin structured practice of initial /s/ and /f/ at the imitated word level with strong visual and verbal cues.\n- Encourage parent to model clear /s/ and /f/ words in daily routines (e.g., \"sun,\" \"sock,\" \"fish,\" \"food\") without asking child to repeat yet; focus on exposure.\n- Monitor tolerance for more structured practice and consider introducing simple CV syllables if needed."

Family has been trying to emphasize \"teeth\" for /s/ at home. No major changes in overall speech clarity reported.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered room more easily today and appeared eager to show toys from home. Good participation in tabletop activities when kept brief and interspersed with movement breaks. Followed simple directions and responded positively to praise.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /s/ in CV syllables and single words (imitation)\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation and in simple CV syllables (\"see,\" \"sue,\" \"sah\") using mirror and visual cues for tongue and teeth. Child achieved more consistent /s/ in isolation with clinician support. At the word level (sun, sock, soup, sit), productions were still inconsistent but slightly clearer than baseline. Child occasionally self-corrected when cued to “show teeth.” Accuracy remains emerging; continued need for direct modeling and repetition.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)\n- Focused on establishing /f/ in isolation using “bite lip and blow” cue. Child produced more recognizable /f/ sounds with clinician modeling and tactile cue to touch lower lip. Introduced CV syllables (\"fee,\" \"fo,\" \"fa\"), with some accurate attempts when slowed down. Word-level productions (fish, fan, foot) still often reduced to /p/ or /h/, though a few closer approximations were observed.\n\n3. /s/ blends at imitated word level\n- Re-introduced simple /s/ blends (spin, stop, spill, stack) in a car and block game. Child frequently omitted the /s/ or simplified the cluster (\"pin,\" \"top,\" \"pill\"). With simultaneous production and segmenting (\"s\" + \"pin\"), child occasionally included a quieter /s/ at the beginning. Accuracy remains low but tolerance for practice improved; child stayed engaged with the game.\n\n4. General speech in play\n- During free play, child used many single words and some 2–3 word phrases (e.g., \"my car,\" \"more bubbles\"). Intelligibility to clinician remained reduced but slightly better when familiar vocabulary was used. Parent noted that child is trying more words overall.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to solidify /s/ and /f/ in isolation and CV syllables, with short sets of imitated words.\n- Maintain /s/ blends at imitated word level only; focus on awareness of the “snake sound” at the start of the word.\n- Encourage parent to practice “snake sound” /s/ in front of a mirror for a few minutes daily and to praise any attempts, regardless of accuracy.\n- Reassess readiness to expand /s/ words if accuracy and consistency improve."

No new concerns.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated easily from parent and transitioned smoothly into the therapy room. Demonstrated good attention to clinician’s face and mirror during sound practice. Required occasional redirection when play became more self-directed, but overall cooperation was strong.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /s/ in CV syllables and single words (imitation, beginning phrases)\n- Child showed a noticeable increase in accuracy for /s/ in isolation and CV syllables with only brief visual and verbal cues. At the imitated word level (sun, soap, sock, soup, sit), productions were more consistent, with clearer /s/ onset. Some substitutions (/z/, /d/) still occurred, but child often responded to a single cue (\"teeth and air\") to correct the production. Trialed /s/ in short carrier phrases (\"my sun,\" \"see sock\") with mixed success; required models but tolerated the shift to phrase-level practice.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in CV syllables and words (imitation)\n- Continued work on /f/ using mirror and “bite lip and blow” cue. Child produced /f/ in CV syllables (\"fee,\" \"foo,\" \"fa\") with improved consistency. At the imitated word level (fish, fan, four, foot), several accurate productions were noted, especially when the child took extra time. Still occasional stopping to /p/ (\"pish\"), but fewer than previous sessions. Overall, emerging improvement in word-level /f/.\n\n3. /s/ blends at imitated word level\n- Practiced /s/ blends (spin, stop, spill, stack, slide) during a board game. Child showed a few more attempts at including /s/ (e.g., a quiet or shorter /s/ before the rest of the word). Still frequent cluster reduction, but willingness to try full blends increased. Segmenting (\"s\" + \"top\") and backward chaining were somewhat helpful. Accuracy remains low, but participation is good.\n\n4. Early final consonants in play (informal probe)\n- Briefly probed final /p/ and /m/ in familiar words (up, cup, mom). Child was often able to mark the final consonant in imitation, though not consistently in spontaneous speech. This will be monitored for future goal development.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on /s/ and /f/ at the imitated word level while beginning to trial simple carrier phrases when accuracy is strong.\n- Continue structured /s/ blend practice with heavy modeling and segmentation.\n- Parent encouraged to use short phrases with /s/ and /f/ at home (e.g., \"see sun,\" \"fun fish\") and to model slowly rather than prompting frequent repetitions.\n- If consistency with /s/ words remains strong, plan to increase phrase-level practice next session."

Family reports that familiar listeners are understanding these words more easily. Parent still notes difficulty with blends and some \"missing sounds\" at the ends of words.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child arrived in a positive mood and was eager to start. Maintained attention well for short drill activities when embedded in games. Showed good imitation of clinician’s mouth positions and enjoyed using the mirror. Minimal redirection required.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /s/ at word and carrier phrase level (imitation and emerging spontaneous)\n- Child demonstrated increased consistency for initial /s/ in imitated single words (sun, soap, sock, soup, sit, sand). Many productions had a clear, sustained /s/ with minimal cueing. Transitioned to simple carrier phrases (\"I see ___,\" \"my ___\") with /s/ words. With models, child produced several accurate phrase-level productions and occasionally initiated phrases independently (e.g., \"see sun\") during play. This reflects a moderate, meaningful step up from prior sessions.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in words and short phrases (imitation)\n- Practiced initial /f/ in words (fish, four, fan, food, fun) using visual and verbal cues. Accuracy at the word level improved, with more consistent use of the correct lip position. Occasional substitutions (/p/) still present but less frequent. Introduced short modeled phrases (\"fun fish,\" \"four feet\") in structured play; child could imitate some of these with fair clarity when slowed down.\n\n3. /s/ blends at imitated word level and structured play\n- Continued practice of /s/ blends (spin, stop, spill, slide, spot) within a turn-taking game. Child showed more frequent attempts to include a brief /s/ before the rest of the word, especially with backward chaining and visual cueing. Accuracy is still emerging, but compared to earlier sessions, there was a clearer awareness of the /s/ portion of the blend. Child required moderate verbal and visual cues and occasional simultaneous productions.\n\n4. Final consonants (informal probe and brief practice)\n- Briefly targeted final /t/ and /p/ in imitation (e.g., \"cat,\" \"hat,\" \"cup,\" \"up\"). Child was able to mark final consonants in several imitated trials when cued to “tap the sound at the end.” Spontaneous productions during play still frequently omitted final consonants. This will remain a secondary focus for now.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen initial /s/ and /f/ at the word and short phrase level, aiming for increased independence and spontaneous use.\n- Maintain /s/ blend work at the imitated word level, using segmentation and backward chaining.\n- Encourage parent to model simple phrases with /s/ and /f/ (e.g., \"see soap,\" \"fun food\") during routines like bath time and meals.\n- If phrase-level /s/ continues to be strong, consider introducing very simple sentence frames in future sessions."

No major changes in how well others understand the child overall. Parent has been practicing short /s/ and /f/ phrases as suggested.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated from parent without difficulty. Attention was generally good, though there were a few moments of silliness and distraction when tasks became more repetitive. Responded well to quick movement breaks and praise.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /s/ at word and carrier phrase level (imitation and emerging spontaneous)\n- Child maintained similar performance to last week. Produced many accurate initial /s/ words in imitation (sun, sock, soup, sand, sit) with light verbal cues. In carrier phrases (\"I see sun,\" \"my soap\"), accuracy was fair but variable; some phrases were clear, while others showed reduced /s/ or substitution. Spontaneous use of /s/ in familiar words occurred occasionally during play but was not yet consistent.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in words and short phrases (imitation)\n- Continued work on initial /f/ at the word level (fish, four, fan, food). Accuracy was similar to previous session, with several clear productions when child attended to lip placement. Occasional /p/ substitutions persisted. Modeled short phrases (\"four fish,\" \"fun food\") remained at the imitated level; child needed direct models and did not yet use these spontaneously.\n\n3. /s/ blends at imitated word level\n- Practiced /s/ blends (spin, stop, slide, spill, spot) in a board game. Child continued to omit /s/ in many attempts (\"pin,\" \"top\"), though a few productions included a brief /s/ when strongly cued. Performance was comparable to last week; no notable jump in accuracy, but the child tolerated repeated practice and remained engaged.\n\n4. Final consonants (brief practice)\n- Revisited final /t/ and /p/ in imitation (cat, hat, cup, up). Child could mark final consonants with cueing but did not yet carry this over into spontaneous speech. This remains a lower priority target.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue practicing /s/ and /f/ at the word and carrier phrase level, focusing on maintaining gains and increasing consistency.\n- Keep /s/ blends at the imitated word level; focus on awareness and willingness to attempt the full cluster.\n- Parent encouraged to continue home practice with short, fun games (e.g., pointing to pictures and saying \"see sun,\" \"fun fish\"), keeping practice brief and positive.\n- Monitor for readiness to expand phrase-level work when productions become more reliable."

Demonstrated good eye contact and watched clinician’s mouth closely during sound practice. Needed occasional prompts to stay seated but quickly returned to task.\n\nGoals and observations:\n1. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases (imitation and increasing independence)\n- Child showed slightly increased consistency for /s/ in imitated words and short carrier phrases. Many initial /s/ words (sun, soap, sock, soup, sand, sit) were produced clearly with only minimal verbal cues. In carrier phrases (\"I see sun,\" \"my sock,\" \"see soup\"), accuracy improved compared to previous sessions, with more phrases containing a clear /s/. Child occasionally initiated short phrases independently during play (e.g., \"see sun\") when prompted by pictures.\n\n2. Initial /f/ in words and short phrases (imitation)\n- Practiced initial /f/ in words (fish, four, fan, food, fun) with mirror support. Child produced more consistent /f/ in imitation, though still required reminders to bite the lip. Some short phrases (\"fun fish,\" \"four feet\") were imitated more accurately today. Spontaneous use of initial /f/ remains limited but approximations are clearer.\n\n3. /s/ blends at imitated word level\n- Continued targeting /s/ blends (spin, stop, slide, spill, spot, ski) using a minimal pair approach (e.g., \"pin\" vs. \"spin\"). Child was often able to identify when the clinician included the /s/ but had difficulty consistently producing it themselves. A few productions contained a more audible /s/ at the start, particularly with /st/ words. Overall, accuracy is slowly improving but still requires high levels of support.\n\n4. Final consonants (brief practice in play)\n- Incorporated final /t/ and /p/ into a simple picture game (cat, hat, cup, up). Child marked some final consonants in imitation and occasionally in prompted phrases (\"my cup\") with verbal cueing. Spontaneous use remains limited.\n\nPlan/recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen /s/ and /f/ at the word and phrase level, reinforcing self-monitoring and self-corrections.\n- Maintain /s/ blends with visual and auditory discrimination tasks plus supported production.\n- Parent encouraged to praise any self-corrections at home and to provide gentle reminders (\"teeth sound\" or \"lip bite\") rather than frequent direct corrections.\n- Consider gradually increasing phrase complexity for /s/ if consistency continues to improve."

No major changes in speech since initial evaluation. Family is motivated to work on home practice when given ideas.\n\nBehavior/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with brief hesitation but joined play with minimal encouragement. Sat at table for short activities and then preferred floor play. Responded well to visual supports and turn-taking games. Attention was variable but could be re-engaged with new materials.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Establish production of final consonants (p, t, m) in isolation and simple syllables\n- Practiced final /p, t, m/ in VC syllables (e.g., \"up,\" \"eat,\" \"am\") at the imitation level. Child frequently omitted the final consonant or added a vowel (e.g., \"uh\" for \"up\"). With maximal verbal models, slowed rate, and visual cueing (pointing to mouth), child produced clearer final consonants in a small number of attempts. Accuracy was inconsistent and required frequent repetition.\n\n2) Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Introduced \"back sound\" /k/ using tongue-back placement cue and mirror. In isolation, child produced /k/ with moderate verbal and visual cues but tended to substitute /t/ in syllables. During CV practice (\"koo, key, kah\"), accuracy was low and the child often reverted to /t/ despite modeling. Tactile cue to gently touch under chin helped occasional correct productions.\n\n3) Initial /s/ in isolation\n- Explored /s/ as a \"quiet snake sound.\" Child could approximate a prolonged airflow sound but often added a /t/ or /d/ onset. In isolation, a few clear /s/ productions were observed with direct imitation and modeling of smile and airflow. At this time, child was not ready to move to syllables.\n\n4) Early word-level practice with high-value words\n- Used a small set of functional words (\"up, pop, more, me\") to observe natural productions. Child often reduced consonant clusters and omitted final sounds. Occasional clearer productions occurred with imitation but were not consistent.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to build awareness of final sounds and back sound /k/ at isolation and simple syllable levels. Maintain focus at imitation level with heavy cueing next session.\n- Caregiver encouraged to emphasize final sounds in play (e.g., stretching \"up-p-p\") and to model, not pressure, for corrections.\n- Next session: re-check tolerance for mirror work, consider introducing simple CVC words once VC improves."

No concerns with hearing or general health this week.\n\nBehavior/engagement:\n- Child entered room willingly and chose cars and blocks for play. Attention was fair with some impulsivity; needed frequent reminders to wait and listen before speaking. Responded well to short, game-like drills and sticker reinforcement.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Final consonants (p, t, m) in VC/CVC syllables\n- Revisited final /p, t, m/ at the imitation level. Compared to last week, child showed more consistent attempts but accuracy remained low-moderate. In VC items (\"up, eat, am\"), final consonants were sometimes present but often weak or followed by an extra vowel. With verbal cues (\"stop your voice\" and \"close your lips\"), child produced a small number of clearly marked final consonants. CVC words (\"cup, cat, mom\") were trialed briefly; child generally omitted the final sound.\n\n2) Initial /k/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Continued to practice /k/ as a \"back sound\" using mirror and tongue-back cues. Child produced several accurate /k/ sounds in isolation when given models and time. In CV syllables (\"koo, key\"), substitutions of /t/ remained common, though a few improved approximations were heard with slowed rate and visual cueing.\n\n3) Initial /s/ in isolation\n- Practiced \"snake sound\" /s/ with visual cue of finger moving like a snake. Child produced a mix of /s/ and /sh/-like sounds. Airflow control was slightly better today, but the sound remained inconsistent and required full models. No move to syllables yet.\n\n4) Functional words in play\n- During play, clinician modeled target words (\"up, pop, more, go\") and noted that child imitated some attempts but often reduced or omitted consonants. Limited spontaneous self-correction observed. Intelligibility in play remained similar to last session.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Skills appear generally similar to last week, with some increased attempts but not yet consistent. Continue at current hierarchy level for final consonants, /k/, and /s/ with strong modeling and visual cues.\n- Caregiver encouraged to highlight end sounds in familiar words during books and routines.\n- Next session: consider introducing a simple picture schedule to support attention during short drill activities."

Compared to previous sessions, child showed emerging improvement. In VC syllables, final consonants were more consistently present, though still sometimes weak or followed by a schwa. In CVC words, child produced clearer final /p/ and /m/ in imitation with moderate verbal and visual cues. Occasional spontaneous final consonants were heard in structured play (e.g., \"up\" while lifting a toy), indicating early carryover.\n\n2) Initial /k/ in CV and simple CVC words\n- Continued work on initial /k/ using mirror and tactile cue at the throat (\"back sound\"). Child produced /k/ in isolation with fair consistency. In CV syllables (\"koo, key, kah\"), accuracy was improved with fewer /t/ substitutions. Trialed a small set of CVC words (\"car, key, cow\") at the imitation level; child required moderate prompts but was able to produce several recognizable /k/-initial words.\n\n3) Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Practiced \"snake sound\" /s/ in isolation, then in CV syllables (\"see, soo\"). Child was able to maintain airflow for /s/ more consistently today, with fewer /sh/ substitutions. In CV attempts, child produced approximations that were closer to target, though still needed direct models and reminders to keep the tongue behind the teeth.\n\n4) Functional words in structured play\n- During a simple board game, clinician targeted high-frequency words (\"go, up, more, stop\"). Child imitated many of these with improved clarity when provided a model first. Some emerging self-corrections were observed (e.g., repeating \"go\" more clearly after an initial reduced form).\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Notable, moderate progress this week in final consonant production and initial /k/. Continue to build consistency at the word level for final consonants and /k/.\n- Maintain focus on /s/ in isolation and early syllables; not yet ready for phrases.\n- Home program: caregiver to practice 5–10 picture words (\"cup, pop, mom, up, cat\") daily, focusing on \"finishing the word\" with a quiet final sound."

Baseline for consonant production in isolation and simple syllables\n   - Probed production of /p, b, m, t, d, k, g, f, s, sh/ in isolation and CV syllables.\n   - Child produced bilabials (/p, b, m/) and alveolars (/t, d/) accurately in isolation and CVs with minimal support.\n   - /k, g/ were fronted to /t, d/ in most attempts; /f/ often stopped to /p/ or omitted; /s/ and /sh/ frequently substituted or distorted.\n   - Required models and verbal cues for most non‑bilabial sounds.\n\n2. Initial /f/ at CV and CVC syllable level (imitation)\n   - Introduced /f/ in CV syllables (\"fee, foo, fah\") using mirror and “bite lip, blow air” cue.\n   - Child achieved a few correct imitated productions with heavy verbal and visual cueing; accuracy inconsistent and often reverted to /p/.\n   - In CVC contexts (\"feet, fun\"), final consonants were often omitted.\n\n3. Final consonant marking in simple CVC words (imitation)\n   - Practiced CVC words with early sounds (e.g., \"map, bed, cup, sun\") at the imitated word level.\n   - Child marked some final consonants with direct models and segmentation (tapping each sound), but often omitted final sounds in spontaneous attempts.\n   - Needed repeated models and slowed rate; benefited from visual cue of “closing the word” with a hand gesture.\n\n4. Early /s/ awareness and listening\n   - Introduced listening task contrasting words with and without /s/ (e.g., \"see\" vs. \"ee\").\n   - Child was able to point to pictures with moderate support but had difficulty hearing the difference independently.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to target initial /f/ in CV and CVC words at the imitated level.\n- Continue work on final consonant marking in CVC words using segmentation and visual “end of word” cues.\n- Maintain listening games for /s/ to build awareness before pushing production.\n- Parent encouraged to model slow, clear CVC words at home in play (e.g., “map, cup, bed”) and gently emphasize final sounds without pressuring child to repeat."

Syllable shapes (CV, CVCV) in play\n   - Observed spontaneous CV and CVCV productions (e.g., “mama, baby, teddy”) with good clarity.\n   - Used these as a context to reinforce final consonants where appropriate.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue focusing on initial /f/ at CV/CVC level, aiming for more consistent accurate productions with faded cues.\n- Maintain emphasis on final consonant marking in simple CVC words; continue using tapping/segmenting strategies.\n- Keep /s/ at listening and isolated production level; not yet ready to move to word‑level /s/.\n- Parent encouraged to practice a small set of /f/ CV words (e.g., “fee, foo, fa”) in front of a mirror once daily, keeping it brief and fun."

Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation and cued spontaneous attempts)\n   - Continued CVC practice (\"cup, map, bed, bus, sun\") using segmentation and visual “end of word” cue.\n   - Child more reliably marked final consonants in imitated productions and occasionally carried this over into short play routines (e.g., saying “bus” clearly during a car game after a single reminder).\n   - Some spontaneous attempts still omitted final consonants, but there were more self‑corrections when cued (e.g., “cu…cup”).\n\n3. /s/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)\n   - Built on previous /s/ work using mirror and “snake sound” cue.\n   - Child achieved a number of clearer /s/ productions in isolation with visual support.\n   - Introduced CV syllables (\"see, soo\"); child could approximate /s/ at the start of syllables in a few trials but often inserted a vowel or changed the sound.\n\n4. Informal observation of multisyllabic word production\n   - During play, child attempted some 2–3 syllable words (\"banana\" → \"nana\", \"elephant\" → \"efant\") with reduced syllables.\n   - Used these attempts to model full syllable shapes but did not formally target this today.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen initial /f/ at word level and begin to probe for short carrier phrases (e.g., “my feet”) if accuracy remains high with cues.\n- Maintain focus on final consonants in CVC words, aiming for more consistent independent use in structured play.\n- Continue /s/ at isolation and simple CV level; not yet ready for consistent word‑level work.\n- Parent encouraged to model and gently prompt for final consonants in a few familiar words (\"cup, bed, bus\"), praising any attempts rather than insisting on perfection."

Needed occasional redirection when activities changed, but generally cooperative.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables\n- Established production of /f/ in isolation using mirror, airflow cues (\"bite lip, blow\"), and visual models. Able to imitate /f/ correctly in isolation in approximately half of opportunities with maximal verbal and visual cueing.\n- At CV level (\"foo, fi, fee, fa\"), accuracy was low; he often substituted /p/ or omitted the sound entirely. Required hand-over-hand support for airflow and close imitation of SLP's model.\n\n2) Final consonant production (bilabials /p, m/ in CVC words)\n- Targeted simple CVC words in play (e.g., \"map, mop, mom, pop\"). Child frequently omitted final consonants in spontaneous attempts (e.g., \"ma\" for \"map\").\n- With immediate imitation and verbal cueing (\"say the end sound\"), he could add a final /p/ or /m/ in some trials, but productions were inconsistent.\n\n3) Initial /s/ at single word level (emerging)\n- Probed initial /s/ in a few high-interest words (\"sun, sock, soap\").\n- Child produced distorted or substituted sounds (often /d/ or a lateralized variant). Required maximal modeling; accurate productions were rare and not yet stable.\n\n4) Syllable shape inventory (CV and CVCV)\n- Observed spontaneous use of CV (\"ma, no, go\") and CVCV (\"mama, dada\") structures during play.\n- Accuracy of consonants within these shapes was variable, with frequent omissions or substitutions, but syllable rhythm was generally present.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Continue to establish consistent /f/ production in isolation and CV syllables next session before moving to words.\n- Maintain focus on final consonants /p, m/ in simple CVC words with strong visual and verbal cues.\n- Provide parent with simple home practice: 3–4 target /f/ sounds in the mirror (no pressure, just playfully copying the \"blowing\" sound), and emphasize final sounds in everyday words (e.g., \"up, pop\") by slightly exaggerating them."

Attention was good for short, repeated practice sets.\n\nGoals / session focus:\n1) Initial /f/ – isolation to CV and early word level\n- Marked improvement compared to last session. In isolation, he produced /f/ accurately in most attempts when given a visual cue (mirror + \"bite your lip, blow\").\n- At CV level, accuracy increased; he produced \"foo, fee, fa\" with more consistent airflow, though rate and precision still fluctuated.\n- Introduced /f/ at word level in imitation (\"four, fish, fun\"). With modeling and verbal cueing, he achieved multiple clear productions, especially in high-interest words like \"fish.\"\n\n2) Final /p/ and /m/ in CVC words\n- Continued practice with picture cards and play (\"map, mop, mop, pop, mom\").\n- Still omitting final consonants in spontaneous attempts, but when cued to \"use your end sound\" he showed more frequent success adding /p/ or /m/ at the end. Accuracy improving but not yet consistent.\n\n3) Initial /s/ – probe at isolation level\n- Spent brief time revisiting /s/ in isolation to determine starting point. With exaggerated visual model (smile, teeth together, long air), he could approximate /s/ in a few trials but tended to stop airflow or slide into other sounds.\n- This remains a more challenging target; will continue with low demand, exploratory practice.\n\n4) Syllable shapes – CVCV\n- In spontaneous play, child used several CVCV forms (e.g., \"tata,\" \"baba\") with clearer vowel contrasts than at initial session.\n- Consonant accuracy within these shapes is still variable, but syllable marking remains strong.\n\nPlan / recommendations:\n- Given today's noticeable gains with /f/, continue to build /f/ at word level in imitation next session and begin exploring simple carrier phrases if accuracy remains strong.\n- Maintain practice of final /p, m/ with parent modeling and gentle reminders (e.g., \"can you say 'up-p'?\"), keeping it playful.\n- Provide parent with a short list of 4–5 /f/ words (e.g., fish, four, fun) to practice in a game format 1–2 times per day."

Noted that child often leaves off “end sounds” and sometimes gets frustrated when not understood. No major changes in communication since the initial evaluation.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child transitioned to the therapy room with mild hesitation but separated from caregiver with reassurance. Once in the room, engaged well with toys and participated in structured play. Attention was variable; required intermittent redirection back to tasks but was generally cooperative.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Initial /f/ at syllable and word level (imitated)\n- Introduced initial /f/ in isolation using visual cue for “lip bite and quiet air.” Child was able to imitate /f/ in isolation in approximately half of opportunities with maximal verbal and visual cues. At the syllable level (e.g., “fa, foo, fee”) and simple words (e.g., “fun, four”), productions were mostly approximations (e.g., /p/ or /h/) despite modeling. Required frequent reminders to keep teeth on lip and use long, quiet air.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple syllables (imitated)\n- Practiced /s/ in isolation with mirror support. Child produced a clear /s/ in some attempts, but often substituted /t/ or a lateralized sound. In CV syllables (e.g., “see, soo”), accuracy was low, with frequent stopping. Required maximal verbal cues to “keep tongue behind teeth and blow.”\n\n3. Final consonant production (awareness and simple CVC words)\n- In play-based tasks, child frequently omitted final consonants (e.g., “ca” for “cat,” “do” for “dog”). With direct imitation and visual cueing (pointing to the end of a picture), child occasionally added final sounds, but this was inconsistent. Accuracy remained low overall, indicating this remains an emerging skill.\n\n4. Functional communication in play\n- Child used mainly 2–3 word phrases (e.g., “my turn,” “more bubbles”) spontaneously. Speech was often reduced in clarity due to sound errors, but intent was generally understandable in context. Accepted models for slightly longer phrases (e.g., “more bubbles please”) and occasionally imitated them.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to target initial /f/ and /s/ at the isolation and simple syllable levels with heavy visual/verbal cueing.\n- Continue to build awareness of final consonants in high-interest CVC words.\n- Encourage parent to model clear /f/ and /s/ sounds during daily routines (e.g., “fish,” “feet,” “soap”) without pressure for the child to repeat.\n- Plan to gather additional baseline data on /s/ blends in the next session."

Initial /f/ in isolation and word level (imitated)\n- Child showed improved consistency producing /f/ in isolation when given a visual model. Accuracy was high once cued to “bite lip and blow,” and child began to anticipate this cue. At the word level (e.g., “fish, four, fun, feet”), accuracy improved compared to baseline, with several clearly produced /f/ words in imitation. Occasional substitutions to /p/ still occurred, especially when excited or speaking quickly, but overall productions were noticeably clearer.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitated)\n- Child demonstrated better control of /s/ in isolation, achieving more consistent airflow with fewer stops to /t/. In CV syllables (e.g., “see, soo, si”), accuracy increased with direct imitation and mirror support. Child was able to correct some errors when given a second model, indicating emerging self-awareness.\n\n3. Final consonant production in high-frequency CVC words\n- Continued focus on final consonants in words such as “cat, dog, bus, hat.” With imitation and visual cues (tapping for the last sound), child produced some accurate final consonants, particularly /t/ and /s/, though not yet consistently. Compared to last week, there were more successful trials and fewer complete omissions, suggesting early progress.\n\n4. Functional communication in structured play\n- Child used a mix of 2–3 word phrases and occasional 4-word utterances with modeling (e.g., “I want more bubbles,” “put it in”). Speech remained reduced in intelligibility due to sound errors, but the child was more willing to attempt longer phrases after clinician models.\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Maintain focus on initial /f/ and /s/ at the imitated word level to consolidate recent gains.\n- Continue practice of final consonants in a small set of functional CVC words.\n- Encourage parent to provide models emphasizing /f/ and /s/ in familiar words during play and routines, praising any attempts.\n- If gains continue, consider trialing simple carrier phrases with target /f/ words in upcoming sessions."

Noted that familiar family members are understanding the child a bit more, though speech is still “mumbly” at times.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child separated easily from caregiver and quickly engaged with therapy materials. Demonstrated good participation in both structured and play-based tasks. Occasional silliness but generally redirected with minimal prompting. Motivation was high when activities were game-like or involved turn-taking.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Initial /f/ at word and simple phrase levels\n- Child produced initial /f/ words (e.g., “fish, four, fun, feet, fan”) with good accuracy in imitation and began to produce some of these words independently during play (e.g., spontaneously saying “fish” while playing with a puzzle). When given a simple carrier phrase (“my fish,” “four fish”), the child was able to imitate short phrases with mostly clear /f/ productions. Cues were gradually reduced, and the child often maintained accuracy, indicating a meaningful increase in independence.\n\n2. Initial /s/ in CV syllables and word level (imitated)\n- Practiced /s/ in CV syllables and a small set of words (e.g., “sun, soap, soup, see”). Child showed noticeably better accuracy compared to prior sessions, with fewer substitutions to /t/. With verbal reminders to “keep tongue behind teeth and blow,” the child was able to produce clearer /s/ in many imitated words. Some inconsistency remained, but overall performance was stronger.\n\n3. Early /s/ blends (awareness and imitation)\n- Introduced awareness of /s/ blends at the word level (e.g., “star, spoon, stop”) using slow, segmented models. Child was able to imitate a few approximations but often omitted the /s/ or reduced the cluster (e.g., “tar” for “star”). This was presented as an exploratory activity to gauge readiness; child tolerated the task but required maximal modeling and did not yet show consistent accuracy.\n\n4. Final consonants in functional words\n- Continued practice with final /t, p, m/ in high-interest CVC words. Child showed more frequent marking of final sounds when given a model and cueing (e.g., pointing to the last sound). Some spontaneous carryover was observed within structured play (e.g., producing a clearer “up” after the clinician emphasized the final /p/ earlier in the session).\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue to strengthen initial /f/ at phrase level and begin to look for more spontaneous use in play.\n- Maintain focus on initial /s/ at the imitated word level, aiming for increased consistency.\n- Briefly probe /s/ blends in upcoming sessions to monitor readiness but keep primary work at the single-consonant level.\n- Encourage parent to model short phrases with target words (e.g., “my fish,” “see sun”) and praise any attempts, without correcting every error."

Still notices difficulties with words that have two consonants together (e.g., “spoon”). No concerns with hearing or health this week.\n\nBehaviour/engagement:\n- Child entered the room willingly and was eager to show the clinician a toy from home. Maintained attention well during table-top tasks and followed directions with minimal repetition. Participated actively, especially when activities were fast-paced and involved movement.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Initial /f/ in short phrases and simple sentences\n- Child produced initial /f/ words accurately in imitation and began using them more consistently in short, structured phrases (e.g., “my fish,” “big fan”) and simple sentence frames (e.g., “I see a fish”). Cues were reduced to occasional verbal reminders, and the child often maintained a clear /f/ without direct prompting. This represents a continued upward trend in independence.\n\n2. Initial /s/ at word and emerging phrase level (imitated)\n- Practiced a set of initial /s/ words (e.g., “sun, soap, sock, soup”) with picture support. The child achieved more consistent accurate productions during imitation, with fewer substitutions and better airflow. Briefly expanded to short phrases such as “sun up” or “sock on” in imitation. At this stage, the child required moderate cues but was generally able to approximate the target.\n\n3. /s/ blends at imitated word level (exploratory)\n- Revisited simple /s/ blends (e.g., “star, spoon, stop, spin”) with a focus on slow, segmented modeling and backward chaining. Child showed some initial success in imitating blended forms when given maximal cues, though accuracy was variable and the /s/ was sometimes reduced. This remains a developing area but the child appeared more tolerant of repeated practice compared to earlier attempts.\n\n4. Final consonant marking in structured play\n- In CVC words targeted within a game (e.g., “bus, hat, map”), the child demonstrated increased attempts to mark final consonants when cued. Some words were produced with clearer final sounds, though consistency is not yet at a level for generalization. Occasional self-corrections were observed after clinician models (e.g., repeating “bus” with a clearer /s/ at the end).\n\nPlan / Recommendations:\n- Continue building phrase- and early sentence-level practice for initial /f/.\n- Maintain work on initial /s/ at the word level with gradual introduction of short phrases.\n- Keep /s/ blends as a secondary focus, using brief, highly supported practice.\n- Suggest parent continue to highlight /f/ and /s/ words in routines and read short picture books emphasizing these sounds."

Participation was adequate; needed a few extra prompts to stay with non-preferred tasks. Overall, remained cooperative and responded well to breaks and praise.\n\nGoals / Observations:\n1. Initial /f/ at phrase and early sentence level\n- Continued practice with initial /f/ in phrases and simple sentences. Child maintained generally good accuracy for /f/ in imitated phrases (e.g., “funny fish,” “five frogs”) and was able to produce some short sentences with models (e.g., “I see five fish”). Compared to last week, performance was similar, with some variability in attention impacting consistency rather than a change in skill level.\n\n2. Initial /s/ at word level and short phrases (imitated)\n- Targeted initial /s/ words (e.g., “sun, soap, soup, sock”) again. Child produced many accurate imitations when focused, but accuracy dropped when attention waned. Phrases such as “sun up” or “sock on” were imitated with moderate success. Overall performance appeared comparable to the previous session, with skills consolidating at this level.\n\n3. /s/ blends at imitated word level\n- Practiced a small set of /s/ blends (e.g., “spoon, star, stop, spin”) with visual and verbal cues.
