    note_text: `Parent report:
- Caregiver reported ongoing concerns about clarity of speech, especially with unfamiliar listeners. Noted that child is "chatty" but often hard to understand beyond family. No major changes since initial evaluation.

Behaviour/engagement:
- Child transitioned to the therapy room with brief hesitation, then engaged well with play-based activities. Required occasional redirection from preferred toys but responded to visual schedules and clear expectations. Participated in turn-taking games with support.

Goals / session focus:
1. Establish production of /k/ in isolation and simple syllables (CV)
- At baseline, child consistently fronted /k/ to /t/ in spontaneous speech (e.g., "tat" for "cat").
- With direct modeling and use of a "back sound" cue (touching throat, visual of tongue placement), child produced /k/ in isolation inconsistently. Able to achieve a clear /k/ in approximately half of imitated attempts with maximal verbal and visual cueing.
- Briefly trialed /k/ in CV syllables (e.g., "koo," "kah"); accuracy was low and required simultaneous production with clinician.

2. Initial /f/ at syllable and word level (imitation)
- Child often substituted /p/ for /f/ in conversation (e.g., "pish" for "fish").
- In structured imitation tasks, able to approximate /f/ with strong airflow when given "bite your lip and blow" cue and visual model. Accuracy higher in isolation than in syllables.
- At word level (e.g., "fun," "feet," "fish"), productions were mostly stopped to /p/ even with cues; a few accurate productions emerged with very slow rate and repeated modeling.

3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple syllables
- Child produced /s/ in isolation with inconsistent airflow; some productions were lateral or reduced to /t/.
- With mirror work and "snake sound" cue, able to produce a clearer /s/ intermittently, but needed ongoing reminders to keep tongue behind teeth.
- Did not yet move into word-level /s/ this session due to focus on establishing consistent sound.

4. Functional communication / phrase length (observation only)
- During play, child used mostly 3–4 word utterances (e.g., "I want that one," "my turn now"), but speech was often reduced in clarity due to sound errors and fast rate.

Plan / recommendations:
- Continue to target /k/ and /f/ in isolation and simple syllables with maximal support next session.
- Introduce more structured CV and VC practice for /k/ and /f/ as tolerated.
- Encourage caregiver to model slow, clear productions of words with /k/ and /f/ in daily routines without asking child to repeat every time (e.g., "keys," "cup," "fish," "food").
- Plan to gather additional baseline data on /s/ blends in upcoming sessions once single sound /s/ stabilizes.`,

    note_text: `Parent report:
- Caregiver shared that child is starting junior kindergarten in the fall and wants them to be easier for peers to understand. No notable changes in speech since last visit, though caregiver thinks /k/ is "a tiny bit better" in some practiced words.

Behaviour/engagement:
- Child separated from caregiver more smoothly today and joined the therapist at the table with minimal prompting. Demonstrated good participation in turn-based games and was motivated by stickers and a simple board game. Attention to task was generally good with brief movement breaks.

Goals / session focus:
1. /k/ in CV and VC syllables (imitation)
- Building on prior isolation work, child practiced /k/ in CV (e.g., "koo, kah, kee") and VC (e.g., "ak, ik").
- With verbal cueing ("back sound") and visual model, accuracy improved compared to last session. Child produced more consistent /k/ at the start and end of syllables with moderate cueing rather than maximal.
- Noted some spontaneous self-correction attempts when fronting to /t/ (e.g., said "too," paused, then attempted "koo" with support).

2. Initial /k/ at word level (imitation)
- Introduced simple /k/ initial words (e.g., "key, cow, car, cat").
- Child was able to imitate several words with a recognizable /k/ when given a slowed model and occasional tactile cue (light touch to throat/under chin to cue "back" sound).
- Errors included fronting to /t/ or omitting the initial consonant; however, accurate productions were more frequent than at baseline, indicating emerging word-level skills.

3. Initial /f/ in isolation and CV syllables
- Continued work on /f/ in isolation with "bite your lip and blow" cue. Child showed clearer, more consistent airflow compared to previous session.
- Practiced CV syllables ("foo, faa, fee"); able to maintain /f/ in initial position in about half of imitated attempts with moderate cueing.
- Word-level practice remained challenging, with frequent /p/ substitutions, but there were a few clearer approximations when rate was slowed and visual attention to the clinician's mouth was encouraged.

4. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables
- Child showed slightly more consistent /s/ in isolation with visual feedback in the mirror.
- Trialed /s/ in CV combinations (e.g., "soo, see"). Productions varied between accurate /s/, /sh/, and /t/. Verbal reminders to "keep tongue behind teeth" were somewhat helpful, but the sound is still emerging.

Plan / recommendations:
- Continue to strengthen /k/ at the word level in imitation; if consistency continues to improve, consider introducing a small set of functional /k/ words for use in simple phrases.
- Maintain focus on /f/ in isolation and syllables; delay heavy word-level demands until accuracy is more stable.
- Continue shaping /s/ in isolation with mirror work and airflow cues.
- Caregiver encouraged to play short "sound games" at home, focusing on making long /k/ and /f/ sounds together in a playful way rather than drilling words.`,

    note_number: 3,
    note_text: `Parent report:
- Caregiver reported noticing clearer /k/ in a few familiar words at home (e.g., "car," "cookie") when the child is reminded. They feel others still have difficulty understanding the child in conversation. No new concerns.

Behaviour/engagement:
- Child entered session happily and was eager to show a toy car from home. Participated well in both floor play and table tasks. Needed occasional prompts to stay seated during drill activities, but returned to tasks with gentle reminders.

Goals / session focus:
1. Initial /k/ at word level (imitation → supported spontaneous)
- Practiced a set of familiar /k/ words ("car, cat, key, cookie, coat") using pictures and toy items.
- Child imitated /k/ initial words with noticeably improved accuracy compared to last week, often needing only a brief visual model and occasional verbal cue.
- Began to use some /k/ words spontaneously in structured play (e.g., saying "car go" while moving the toy car), though consistency in spontaneous use is still emerging.

2. Initial /k/ in 2–3 word phrases (imitation)
- Introduced short carrier phrases (e.g., "my car," "big cat," "go car") at the imitated phrase level.
- With moderate cueing for the initial /k/, child produced several phrases with a clear /k/ in at least one of multiple trials. Some blends of /t/ and /k/ were observed, but overall clarity was better than at the single-word level during earlier sessions.

3. Initial /f/ at word level (imitation)
- Moved into imitated word-level practice for /f/ ("fish, fun, feet, five") while continuing to use the "bite lip and blow" cue.
- Compared to previous sessions, child demonstrated a more stable /f/ in isolation and was able to carry this over to word-initial position in a meaningful number of attempts.
- Errors still included /p/ substitutions, especially when speech rate increased, but there were clear, accurate productions in structured practice.

4. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables
- Continued shaping /s/ with mirror feedback. Child produced a few sustained, fairly accurate /s/ sounds with verbal reminders.
- CV syllables (e.g., "see, soo") remained inconsistent, with frequent shifts to /sh/ or /t/. However, child showed better awareness of tongue placement and was able to correct with immediate modeling.

Plan / recommendations:
- Given progress, continue to expand /k/ practice at the phrase level with strong visual supports and play-based routines.
- Maintain /f/ at the imitated word level, aiming for more consistent accuracy before moving to phrases.
- Continue to focus on establishing a reliable /s/ sound in isolation; defer /s/ word-level goals until production is more stable.
- Caregiver encouraged to model short phrases with target /k/ words at home (e.g., "my car," "big cookie") and praise any clear /k/ attempts.`,
  },
  {
    note_number: 4,
    note_text: `Parent report:
- Caregiver shared that child is now sometimes correcting themselves on /k/ at home (e.g., "tat—cat!"). They feel /f/ is still hard to hear in words. No new medical or developmental concerns reported.

Behaviour/engagement:
- Child transitioned smoothly into the therapy room and engaged quickly with a car and animal play set. Attention was generally good; needed brief breaks between structured drill sets. Demonstrated good rapport with clinician and responded well to visual timers.

Goals / session focus:
1. Initial /k/ in 2–3 word phrases (imitation → reduced cues)
- Continued practice of phrases such as "my car," "go car," "big cat," "cookie please."
- Compared to last week, child required fewer prompts to produce /k/ accurately within phrases. Often a single model or reminder ("back sound") was sufficient.
- Accuracy in imitated phrases was noticeably higher, and there were more spontaneous attempts during play (e.g., "my car" without a model), though still not fully consistent.

2. Initial /k/ in simple sentences (imitation)
- Introduced short sentences (e.g., "The car is big," "I see a cat") at the imitated level.
- With moderate cueing, child produced /k/ clearly in many attempts, though accuracy decreased as sentence length increased. Some omissions and fronting persisted, but the child was able to repair after a model.

3. Initial /f/ at word level and emerging phrases
- Practiced /f/ initial words ("fish, fun, four, feet") using picture cards and a fishing game.
- Accuracy in imitated words improved from prior sessions, with more consistent /f/ rather than /p/ when rate was controlled and child watched the clinician's mouth.
- Trialed short phrases (e.g., "four fish," "fun food") with mixed success. Child could sometimes maintain /f/ at the start of the first word but often reverted to /p/ in connected speech.

4. /s/ in isolation and initial word probes
- Continued isolation practice for /s/ using mirror and "long snake sound" cue. Child showed better control of airflow and tongue placement.
- Briefly probed initial /s/ words (e.g., "sun, sock, soup") at the imitated level. Productions were variable, including /t/, /sh/, and some approximations of /s/. This will remain a secondary focus while /k/ and /f/ continue to develop.

Plan / recommendations:
- Continue to strengthen /k/ at the phrase and short sentence levels, gradually fading cues as tolerated.
- Maintain /f/ at the word level while gently increasing phrase-level opportunities in structured play.
- Keep /s/ primarily at isolation with occasional word-level probes to monitor readiness.
- Caregiver encouraged to model and emphasize /f/ words during daily routines (e.g., "feet, food, fun") and to praise child's attempts, without overcorrecting.`,

    note_number: 5,
    note_text: `Parent report:
- Caregiver noted that family members are understanding the child a bit more when they talk about cars and cookies, but strangers still have difficulty. They reported hearing a few clearer /f/ words like "four" during playtime.

Behaviour/engagement:
- Child was cheerful on arrival and quickly engaged with a picture book and small figurines. Maintained attention for longer drill sets than previous weeks, with minimal need for redirection. Demonstrated good turn-taking and followed simple game rules with support.

Goals / session focus:
1. Initial /k/ in short sentences and structured play (imitation → emerging spontaneous)
- Continued work on short sentences with /k/ words (e.g., "The car is fast," "I see a cat," "My cookie is big").
- Child showed more consistent accuracy in imitated sentences and required fewer explicit cues for /k/. Often produced /k/ correctly after a single model.
- During car and animal play, child spontaneously produced some /k/ words and short phrases (e.g., "big car," "my cat") with clearer /k/ than previously noted, though not yet across all opportunities.

2. Initial /f/ at word and simple phrase level
- Practiced /f/ words ("fish, four, fun, feet, food") using a fishing game and snack-themed pictures.
- Accuracy at the imitated word level increased compared to last session, with more reliable use of lip-biting and airflow.
- Introduced simple 2-word phrases (e.g., "four fish," "fun food," "big feet"). Child was able to maintain /f/ at the start of some words with verbal reminders, but still occasionally substituted /p/, particularly when speaking quickly.

3. Initial /s/ in isolation and CV syllables
- Continued focus on isolation /s/ with mirror and visual supports. Child produced several clear /s/ sounds in a row with clinician modeling.
- Practiced CV syllables ("see, soo, say") with variable accuracy. Some productions were closer to target /s/, while others shifted to /sh/ or /t/. Child showed increased awareness of tongue position and was willing to adjust after feedback.

4. Functional phrase length and intelligibility in play
- During spontaneous play, child used 3–4 word utterances (e.g., "I want the big car," "my turn now"). Overall intelligibility was slightly improved compared to earlier sessions when talking about practiced /k/ and /f/ words, though speech remained less clear in unpracticed vocabulary.

Plan / recommendations:
- Continue focusing on /k/ in short sentences and structured play, encouraging more spontaneous use of practiced /k/ words.
- Maintain /f/ practice at the word level with ongoing introduction of simple phrases; continue to support accurate lip and airflow patterns.
- Keep building consistency for /s/ in isolation and simple syllables; word-level /s/ will remain limited to probes.
- Caregiver encouraged to notice and praise spontaneous clear /k/ and /f/ productions at home and to model short, slow sentences containing these targets.`,

  {
    note_number: 6,
    note_text: `Parent report:
- Caregiver reported that the child is "really trying" to fix sounds and sometimes asks, "Was that right?" They are hearing more clear /k/ in words like "car" and "cookie" without reminders, and a few clearer /f/ words. No concerns about hearing or health.

Behaviour/engagement:
- Child entered eagerly and requested specific toys. Demonstrated strong engagement with both play-based and structured tasks. Tolerated slightly longer practice sets and responded well to specific praise for effort and accuracy.

Goals / session focus:
1. Initial /k/ in sentences and early conversational contexts
- Continued practice with short sentences containing /k/ (e.g., "I see a cookie," "The car is red," "The cat is sleeping").
- Compared to last week, child needed fewer direct cues and often produced /k/ correctly in the first attempt during imitation.
- In semi-structured conversation about favorite foods and toys, child produced several /k/ words with a clear back sound without being prompted (e.g., "cookie," "cake," "car"). These spontaneous productions represented a noticeable increase in independence.

2. Initial /f/ at word and 2–3 word phrase levels
- Practiced /f/ words and short phrases ("four fish," "fun food," "big feet," "find it") in a game format.
- Accuracy at the imitated word level continued to improve, and the child required fewer reminders to bite the lip.
- Phrases were more successful today, with more consistent /f/ in at least one of the target words per phrase. Occasional /p/ substitutions persisted, especially when excited, but the child frequently attempted to self-correct after feedback.

3. Initial /s/ in isolation, CV syllables, and limited word probes
- Child demonstrated more stable /s/ in isolation, able to hold a "long snake sound" for several seconds with correct tongue placement.
- CV syllables ("see, soo, say, suh") were more accurate than previous sessions, though some productions still shifted to /sh/.
- Briefly probed initial /s/ words ("sun, sock, soup, sit") at the imitated level. Several approximations were close to target /s/, indicating readiness to begin more consistent word-level practice soon.

4. Overall intelligibility in structured play
- In play-based tasks, child used 3–5 word utterances. Intelligibility within familiar topics (cars, animals, food) showed a modest but noticeable improvement, particularly when target sounds /k/ and /f/ were involved.

Plan / recommendations:
- Continue to reinforce /k/ in short sentences and expand to more natural conversation about familiar routines.
- Maintain /f/ practice at the word and phrase levels, with gradual fading of cues as accuracy stabilizes.
- Begin to increase focus on initial /s/ words in imitation next session while still supporting solid isolation skills.
- Caregiver encouraged to give specific feedback at home (e.g., "I heard your good back /k/ in 'cookie'!") and to keep modeling clear, slow speech during shared activities.`,

    note_text: `Parent report:
- Caregiver excitedly reported that relatives commented on the child being easier to understand this week. They notice clearer /k/ in many practiced words and some clearer /f/ in everyday speech. Caregiver is interested in working more on /s/ now that /k/ seems stronger.

Behaviour/engagement:
- Child arrived in good spirits and transitioned quickly. Very engaged with a board game and pretend restaurant play. Demonstrated increased tolerance for corrective feedback and actively asked, "Did I do it?" after some attempts.

Goals / session focus:
1. Initial /k/ in spontaneous sentences and conversation
- Shifted focus from primarily imitated sentences to more natural, child-led conversation involving /k/ words (e.g., talking about cookies, cake, cars, and "going to the park").
- Child produced many /k/ initial words accurately in spontaneous sentences with minimal or no cueing. Occasional fronting to /t/ occurred, but the child often self-corrected after a brief look from the clinician or a gentle reminder.
- Given the high level of independence and consistency observed today, /k/ is approaching conversational-level generalization for a core set of familiar words.

2. Initial /f/ in short sentences and structured conversation
- Expanded /f/ practice to short sentences (e.g., "Four fish swim," "I see food," "My feet are big") during a fishing and restaurant game.
- Compared to previous sessions, child maintained /f/ more consistently across both words and short phrases, with fewer /p/ substitutions.
- In semi-structured conversation about favorite foods and family, several spontaneous /f/ words were produced with clearer lip posture (e.g., "five," "food," "four"). Some errors remained, but overall independence improved.

3. Initial /s/ at word level (imitation) with continued isolation practice
- Built on improved isolation skills to target initial /s/ words ("sun, sock, soup, seat, soap") at the imitated word level.
- Child was able to produce several clear /s/ initial words when given a model and reminder to "keep tongue behind teeth." Accuracy was higher than during earlier probes and improved over the course of the activity.
- Continued brief isolation practice between word trials to reset tongue placement, which helped maintain accuracy.

4. Functional intelligibility and self-monitoring
- Child used 3–5 word sentences in play (e.g., "My car goes fast," "I want four cookies").
- Intelligibility with the clinician was noticeably better, particularly for practiced vocabulary, and the child showed emerging self-monitoring (asking if productions were correct and attempting repairs).

Plan / recommendations:
- Begin to consider reducing direct focus on /k/ in structured drills, shifting more practice into conversational and carryover tasks.
- Continue to solidify /f/ at sentence level and encourage more spontaneous use in everyday topics.
- Increase emphasis on initial /s/ at the imitated word level, while continuing brief isolation practice as needed.
- Caregiver encouraged to incorporate "sound hunts" at home (e.g., looking for /s/ items like "sock, soap") and to continue praising clear /k/ and /f/ productions in daily routines.`,

    note_text: `Parent report:
- Caregiver reported that the child is talking a lot at home and is easier to understand in familiar routines. They are starting to notice some better /s/ words, like "sun" and "sock," but say it is not yet consistent. No new concerns.

Behaviour/engagement:
- Child transitioned smoothly and remained engaged in both table-top and floor-based activities. Participated well in turn-taking games, though required occasional prompts to slow down speech when excited.

Goals / session focus:
1. /k/ maintenance in conversational speech
- /k/ was monitored rather than directly drilled. During free play and conversation, child frequently used /k/ initial words accurately (e.g., "car," "cookie," "coat," "cup") with no explicit cueing.
- Occasional fronting to /t/ still occurred, but the child often corrected spontaneously or responded quickly to a light reminder.
- Overall, /k/ skills appeared stable at this higher level of the hierarchy.

2. Initial /f/ in short sentences and structured play
- Continued practice with /f/ in short sentences and simple games (e.g., "Four fish jump," "My feet are cold," "I found food").
- Accuracy was generally similar to the previous session, with good success when the child watched the clinician's model and slowed down.
- Some inconsistency remained in faster, more excited speech, but there were multiple clear productions across the session.

3. Initial /s/ at the imitated word level
- Focused on a small set of initial /s/ words ("sun, sock, soup, seat, soap, sand").
- Child produced several accurate /s/ words in imitation when given verbal and visual cues. However, performance fluctuated with fatigue and attention.
- Isolation /s/ practice between trials continued to support correct tongue position, and the child showed a bit more stability compared to earlier sessions, though not a large jump.

4. Overall intelligibility and phrase length
- Child used 3–6 word sentences in structured play. Intelligibility with the clinician remained improved for practiced sounds and topics, with occasional breakdowns on less familiar words.

Plan / recommendations:
- Continue to monitor /k/ in conversation while shifting more direct practice time to /f/ and /s/.
- Maintain current level of challenge for /f/ (short sentences and structured play), focusing on consistency rather than increasing difficulty this week.
- Continue initial /s/ word-level work in imitation, aiming to gradually increase consistency before moving into phrases.
- Caregiver encouraged to keep modeling clear /s/ in everyday words (e.g., "soap, sun, cereal") and to give positive feedback when the child produces a good /s/.`,

    note_number: 9,
    note_text: `Parent report:
- Caregiver stated that speech has been "about the same" as last week. They still hear good /k/ in many words and some clearer /f/ and /s/, but it varies depending on the day and the child's mood.

Behaviour/engagement:
- Child arrived cheerful and cooperative. Attention and participation were similar to the previous session, with good engagement in play-based tasks and mild restlessness during longer drill activities.

Goals / session focus:
1. /k/ in conversational speech (maintenance)
- /k/ continued to be monitored informally. Child produced many /k/ initial words accurately in conversation about cars, animals, and food.
- Occasional fronting persisted, but overall performance was stable compared to last week. No new difficulty observed.

2. Initial /f/ in sentences and structured play
- Practiced /f/ in short sentences (e.g., "Four fish swim," "I feed the fish," "My feet are wet") using a fishing game.
- Accuracy and cueing needs were similar to the prior session. Child produced several clear /f/ initial words and phrases with moderate support.
- Substitutions to /p/ occurred, particularly when the child spoke quickly or was less attentive to the mouth posture. No major change in overall pattern.

3. Initial /s/ at imitated word level and emerging phrases
- Continued work on initial /s/ words ("sun, sock, soup, seat, sand") in imitation.
- Accuracy at the word level was comparable to the previous session: some clear productions with cues, interspersed with /t/ and /sh/ substitutions.
- Briefly trialed 2-word phrases (e.g., "sun up," "sock on") in imitation. Child could sometimes maintain /s/ in the first word, but this remained challenging and required strong cueing.

4. Overall intelligibility
- Child used 3–6 word utterances in play. Intelligibility for the clinician remained similar to last week, with better clarity for practiced /k/ words and variable accuracy for /f/ and /s/.

Plan / recommendations:
- Continue with current targets and difficulty levels for /f/ and /s/, as skills appear to be consolidating.
- Maintain /k/ at a conversational monitoring level with occasional reminders as needed.
- Caregiver encouraged to keep home practice light and positive, focusing on a few target words for /f/ and /s/ rather than many new words.`,

Goals / session focus:
1. /k/ in conversational speech (maintenance)
- /k/ remained strong in spontaneous speech for a variety of familiar words (e.g., "car, cookie, cake, coat").
- Occasional fronting was observed, but overall performance mirrored last week's stability. No new hierarchy changes were introduced.

2. Initial /f/ in sentences and structured play
- Continued practice of /f/ in short sentences and play (e.g., "Four fish jump," "I feed the fish," "My feet are cold").
- Accuracy and need for cueing were consistent with prior sessions. Child produced multiple clear /f/ words with support but still showed /p/ substitutions, especially when speaking quickly or when less focused.

3. Initial /s/ in imitated words and simple phrases
- Targeted the same set of initial /s/ words as last week with imitation and visual/tactile cues.
- Child's accuracy was similar to previous performance: some clear /s/ words when well-cued, alternating with /t/ or /sh/ productions.
- Practiced short 2-word phrases (e.g., "sun up," "sock on") in imitation; child was able to maintain /s/ in a portion of trials but still required substantial support.

4. Overall intelligibility
- Child continued to use 3–6 word utterances in structured play. Intelligibility for the clinician remained steady, with clearer speech for practiced /k/ words and variable clarity for /f/ and /s/.

Plan / recommendations:
- Maintain current goals and difficulty levels for /f/ and /s/ to allow further consolidation before increasing complexity.
- Continue informal monitoring of /k/ in conversation.
- Caregiver encouraged to continue brief, play-based practice of a few key /f/ and /s/ words each day, focusing on slow, clear speech and positive reinforcement.`,

    note_text: `Parent report:
- Caregiver indicated that the week was "about the same" for speech. They continue to hear strong /k/ and some improved /f/ and /s/, but consistency is still a work in progress. No additional concerns were raised.

Behaviour/engagement:
- Child entered willingly and engaged in a similar manner to prior sessions. Attention and participation were steady, with good responsiveness to visual supports and praise.

Goals / session focus:
1. /k/ in conversational speech (maintenance)
- /k/ production in spontaneous conversation remained stable and generally accurate across a range of familiar words.
- Occasional fronting persisted but was infrequent. No additional hierarchical changes were needed this week.

2. Initial /f/ in short sentences and structured conversation
- Continued practice using sentence frames and play (e.g., "I found four fish," "My feet are dirty," "I want food").
- Child's performance was similar to previous sessions: able to produce several clear /f/ initial words with visual and verbal cues, with ongoing substitutions to /p/ when less attentive.

3. Initial /s/ in imitated words and short phrases
- Practiced initial /s/ words and 2-word phrases (e.g., "sun up," "sock on," "soap bubbles") in imitation.
- Accuracy remained variable but comparable to prior weeks. Child produced some clear /s/ with support, but still required frequent reminders for tongue placement and airflow.

4. Overall intelligibility and self-awareness
- Child continued to use multi-word utterances with similar intelligibility to last week. They occasionally asked if their sounds were "right," showing ongoing self-awareness.

Plan / recommendations:
- Continue to reinforce and monitor /k/ in conversation.
- Maintain current practice level for /f/ and /s/, focusing on consistency and confidence rather than advancing task complexity this week.
- Caregiver encouraged to keep practice playful and to highlight moments when the child uses particularly clear /f/ or /s/ words (e.g., "I heard a great /s/ in 'sock'!").`,

- Caregiver reported that speech "feels pretty steady" compared to the last few weeks. They are pleased with how clear /k/ has become and note gradual, but not dramatic, changes for /f/ and /s/.

Behaviour/engagement:
- Child arrived in a positive mood and participated well in familiar routines and games. Attention, cooperation, and response to feedback were consistent with recent sessions.

Goals / session focus:
1. /k/ in conversational speech (maintenance)
- /k/ remained strong and generally accurate across spontaneous conversation. The child used many /k/ initial words (e.g., "cookie, car, cake, coat") clearly without direct cueing.
- Occasional fronting was rare and typically self-corrected with minimal support.

2. Initial /f/ in sentences and structured play
- Practiced /f/ initial words and short sentences in games and picture description (e.g., "Four frogs jump," "I feed the fish," "My feet are wet").
- Performance was comparable to prior weeks: several accurate /f/ productions with visual/verbal cues, interspersed with /p/ substitutions, particularly during faster or less structured speech.

3. Initial /s/ in imitated words and simple phrases
- Continued focus on initial /s/ words and short phrases in imitation (e.g., "sun up," "sock on," "soap bubbles").
- Accuracy and cueing needs remained similar to previous sessions. Child produced some clear /s/ words when attention was high, but consistency across trials is still developing.

4. Overall intelligibility and summary of block
- In structured play and conversation, child's intelligibility is noticeably better than at the start of the block, particularly for /k/ initial words and, to a lesser extent, for /f/.
- /k/ has largely generalized to conversational speech for a functional set of words, while /f/ and /s/ are showing emerging but inconsistent improvements.

Plan / recommendations:
- Continue to monitor /k/ in conversation in future sessions, with less direct drill needed unless regression is observed.
- Ongoing focus on /f/ and /s/ at the current complexity level, aiming for greater consistency before moving into more spontaneous and phrase-level /s/ work.
- Caregiver encouraged to maintain short, daily practice focusing on a few target /f/ and /s/ words, to praise self-corrections, and to model slow, clear speech during shared activities.
- Consider re-evaluating goal hierarchy in upcoming block to reflect strong /k/ progress and continued needs for /f/ and /s/.`,

    note_text: `Session 1

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother attended session and reported that she and father are understanding most of child's speech at home, but extended family and daycare staff often ask for repetition.
- She noted that he is especially hard to understand when he is excited or talking quickly.
- No concerns regarding hearing or recent illnesses.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child transitioned into the therapy room with some initial hesitation but separated from mother with verbal reassurance.
- Once engaged with toys, he was cheerful and talkative, though speech was often unintelligible in connected play.
- Attention to therapist-led tasks was fair; needed frequent redirection back to table activities from free play.

Therapy Goals & Observations:
Goal 1: Establish baseline for consonant production
- Informal speech sound inventory completed during play and picture naming.
- Noted consistent difficulty with: /k, g/ (often fronted to /t, d/), /s/ and /s/ blends (often omitted or substituted with /t/), and /sh/ (often produced as /s/).
- Final consonant deletion observed for /t, k, p/ in short words (e.g., "ca" for "cat").

Goal 2: Initial /k/ at syllable and simple word level (imitation)
- Practiced CV and VC syllables ("ku, ki, ak, ik") with visual cue of "back sound" and mirror.
- Child could approximate /k/ in isolation with maximal verbal and visual cues about 3–4 times; otherwise reverted to /t/.
- In simple words ("car, key, cow"), /k/ was produced accurately only with simultaneous production with SLP and strong cues; otherwise fronting persisted.

Goal 3: Initial /s/ in isolation and simple syllables
- Introduced "snake sound" concept with visual cue and mirror.
- In isolation, child could sustain a clear /s/ approximately 2/6 attempts; other attempts were stopped or produced as /t/.
- In CV syllables ("see, soo"), accuracy was low; required maximal modeling and verbal reminders to keep tongue "behind teeth".

Goal 4: Early word shapes (CVC) with final consonants
- Targeted high-interest CVC words ("pop, mom, boat, hat") in imitation.
- Child frequently omitted final consonants despite direct models; occasional accurate productions with simultaneous production and pointing gesture to final sound.

Plan/Recommendations:
- Continue to build rapport and further assess sound production across contexts.
- Next session will focus on stabilizing /k/ in isolation and CV syllables and continue exploration of /s/.
- Home practice: parent encouraged to model slow, clear productions of target words ("car, key, pop") without pressure for imitation; praise any attempts at "back sounds" and final sounds.`,

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother reported no major changes since last week.
- She has been emphasizing words like "car" and "key" at home; child will sometimes repeat but usually says "tar".
- Daycare staff continue to note that peers have difficulty understanding him in group play.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child entered therapy room more easily today and separated from mother without difficulty.
- Very eager to play with cars and animal toys; talkative throughout session.
- Able to stay with structured tasks for short bursts (3–4 minutes) when embedded in play.

Therapy Goals & Observations:
Goal 1: /k/ in isolation and CV syllables
- Reviewed "back sound" with mirror and tactile cue to throat.
- In isolation, child achieved a clearer /k/ in roughly half of attempts when given a model and reminder to "lift the back of the tongue".
- CV syllables ("koo, kee, kah") practiced in imitation; still inconsistent, but more frequent approximations vs. last session.

Goal 2: Initial /k/ in simple words (imitation)
- Target words: car, key, cow, cookie.
- With direct modeling and slow rate, child produced initial /k/ accurately in some attempts; still frequent /t/ substitutions.
- Visual cue of pointing behind the teeth and slow co-production helped; needed moderate–maximal cueing overall.

Goal 3: /s/ in isolation and CV syllables
- Continued "snake sound" practice with mirror.
- In isolation, child was able to produce a prolonged /s/ more consistently with modeling; still required verbal reminders.
- CV syllables ("see, soo, sa") were attempted in imitation; many productions approximated /s/ but with inconsistent clarity and occasional /t/.

Goal 4: CVC words with final /p, t, m/
- Used picture cards and toys to elicit: pop, up, hat, boat, mom.
- Child continued to frequently omit final consonants, especially in spontaneous play.
- With imitation and gestural cue to "tap the last sound," he produced some accurate CVC forms (e.g., "pop," "mom"), though not yet consistent.

Plan/Recommendations:
- Continue at current levels for /k/ and /s/, focusing on stabilizing productions in imitation.
- Maintain emphasis on final consonants in high-interest words.
- Home practice: parent to play "listening game" noticing when they hear the "back sound" /k/ in daily routines (e.g., car, coat) and give specific praise when child attempts these sounds, regardless of accuracy.`,

    note_text: `Session 3

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother reported that child is starting to attempt "car" more often and she has heard a few clearer "k" sounds, especially when he is speaking slowly.
- She noticed he sometimes corrects himself ("tar" → "car") after she repeats the word.
- No new medical or hearing concerns.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child transitioned smoothly into session and quickly engaged with toys.
- More willing to watch himself in the mirror today and attend to mouth placement.
- Needed occasional breaks between structured trials but returned to task with minimal prompting.

Therapy Goals & Observations:
Goal 1: /k/ in isolation and CV syllables (imitation)
- Child produced a clear /k/ in isolation in most attempts with only brief verbal reminders.
- In CV syllables ("koo, kee, kah, kay"), accuracy improved; many productions had an identifiable back sound, though timing and clarity still variable.
- Less reliance on simultaneous productions; tolerated fading to simple imitation.

Goal 2: Initial /k/ in word level (imitation, emerging spontaneous)
- Target words: car, key, cow, cookie, cat.
- In imitation, child produced initial /k/ with moderate accuracy and required fewer repetitions than previous sessions.
- During play with cars, he spontaneously produced "car" several times; some were fronted, but several had a clear /k/, especially when excited about the toy.

Goal 3: /s/ in isolation and initial /s/ in CV syllables
- Continued "snake sound" practice.
- Isolation: more consistent sustained /s/ when prompted; still occasional distortion but generally recognizable.
- CV syllables ("see, soo, si, sa"): increased number of correct or close approximations vs. last week, though needed visual cueing and reminders to keep tongue behind teeth.

Goal 4: CVC words with final /p, t, m/ (imitation)
- Words: pop, up, hat, boat, mom, map.
- In imitation, child was more frequently marking the final consonant, particularly for /m/ and /p/.
- Still tendency to drop final consonant in spontaneous speech, but with modeling and gestural cues, he could correct himself in some trials.

Plan/Recommendations:
- Begin to trial more word-level practice for /k/ with brief carrier phrases when accuracy is high (e.g., "my car").
- Continue to strengthen /s/ at syllable level before moving to consistent word practice.
- Home practice: encourage child to say "my car," "my key" during play; parent to provide a slow model and praise any clear "back sound" productions.`,

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother shared that child is now using "car" and "cow" more frequently and she can hear the /k/ in some attempts without prompting.
- She has also heard him say "see" and "so" with a clearer "snake sound" on occasion.
- Daycare teacher reported slightly better intelligibility in small-group activities.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child entered the room independently and was eager to show SLP his toy car from home.
- Maintained attention well during car-themed tasks and followed simple directions.
- Cooperative with imitation tasks; occasional silliness but easily redirected.

Therapy Goals & Observations:
Goal 1: Initial /k/ at word level and simple carrier phrases (imitation → cued spontaneous)
- Reviewed single words (car, cow, key, cookie, cat) in imitation; accuracy notably higher than previous sessions with minimal verbal cueing.
- Introduced short carrier phrases: "my car," "big car," "go car" in structured play.
- Child produced several accurate /k/ productions in phrases with light prompting; some spontaneous uses of "my car" with a clear back sound during play.

Goal 2: /k/ in medial position (word level, imitation)
- Introduced medial /k/ in words such as "rocket," "soccer," "pocket" at the imitated word level.
- Child required more support for medial /k/ than initial, but produced emerging accurate attempts when syllables were broken down (e.g., "ro-cket").

Goal 3: /s/ in isolation and initial /s/ at word level (imitation)
- Practiced sustained /s/ in front of mirror; productions were more stable with brief cues.
- Target words: sun, soup, sock, see, soap.
- In imitation, child produced initial /s/ with increasing consistency, though occasional /t/ substitutions and slight distortions were observed.
- Visual cue (finger in front of teeth) and reminder for "long snake sound" were helpful.

Goal 4: CVC words with final /p, t, m, k/ (imitation)
- Words: pop, up, hat, boat, mom, map, back.
- Child is starting to mark final consonants more reliably in imitation, particularly for /p/ and /m/.
- Final /k/ remained more challenging, often reduced or fronted; required segmented practice ("ba" + "ck").

Plan/Recommendations:
- Continue expanding initial /k/ into short phrases while monitoring accuracy.
- Maintain focus on initial /s/ at the word level and gradually increase variety of target words.
- Home practice: parents encouraged to use simple phrases with /k/ words ("big car," "my cookie") and pause to let child imitate; reinforce any attempts at final sounds by repeating and expanding (e.g., child: "bo" → parent: "boat, I see your boat").`,

- Maintained focus for longer stretches of structured practice when activities were game-like.
- Needed occasional sensory breaks (movement, pushing cars) but returned to table tasks with minimal prompting.

Therapy Goals & Observations:
Goal 1: Initial /k/ in carrier phrases (imitation → emerging independent)
- Phrases targeted: "my car," "big car," "red car," "my cookie," "my key."
- Child produced initial /k/ with improved accuracy in imitation and began to use these phrases more independently in play.
- Occasional fronting to /t/ persisted, but child sometimes self-corrected after SLP modeled the phrase.

Goal 2: Medial /k/ in words (imitation)
- Targets: rocket, soccer, pocket, jacket.
- Used syllable segmentation and tapping to support sequencing.
- Accuracy remained variable; child could produce a clearer /k/ in medial position when words were slowed and broken into parts, though carryover into whole words was inconsistent.

Goal 3: Initial /s/ at word level (imitation, limited spontaneous)
- Target words: sun, soup, sock, see, soap, sit.
- Child showed slightly increased consistency of initial /s/ in imitation with visual and verbal cues.
- A few spontaneous uses of "see" and "sock" during play had a recognizable /s/, though others were still reduced or substituted.

Goal 4: CVC words with final /p, t, m, k/ (imitation)
- Continued practice with: pop, up, hat, boat, mom, map, back, book.
- Final /p/ and /m/ were more consistently marked in imitation; final /t/ and /k/ remained more variable.
- Child benefitted from gestural cues (pointing to the end of the word) and slow rate.

Plan/Recommendations:
- Maintain focus on current /k/ and /s/ targets, consolidating gains at phrase and word levels.
- Continue practicing final consonants in a small set of functional CVC words.
- Home practice: parents to choose 3–4 target words (e.g., car, cookie, sun, sock) and use them frequently in simple phrases during daily routines; encourage child to repeat but avoid over-correcting, instead providing a clear model.`,

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother reported that intelligibility is "hit or miss" at home, especially when her child is excited. She notices many words without ending sounds and difficulty with /s/ and /f/ in everyday speech. No recent changes in health or hearing.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child transitioned into the therapy room with some hesitation but joined play after a brief warm-up. Generally cooperative with turn-taking games. Attention was best during highly motivating toy activities; needed occasional redirection when tasks became more structured.

Goals / Therapy Activities:
1. Establish accurate production of /f/ in isolation
   - Introduced /f/ as the "lip-bite, quiet air" sound using mirror and visual cueing. Child was able to approximate /f/ in isolation with maximal verbal and visual prompts. Accuracy was inconsistent; often substituted /p/ or used a prolonged /h/ instead of continuous airflow. Able to achieve a few clear /f/ productions when slowed down and reminded to "bite lip, blow."

2. Initial /f/ in CV and VC syllables (e.g., "fa," "foo," "if")
   - At the imitated syllable level, child required direct models and repeated practice. Productions frequently reduced to /p/ or omitted the consonant. A few accurate productions were observed when pairing with hand cues for airflow. Not yet ready to move to word-level without significant support.

3. Initial /s/ in isolation and simple CV syllables
   - Modeled /s/ as the "snake sound" with tongue placement cues. Child could sometimes generate a prolonged /s/ in isolation with maximal support, but often produced /t/ or /sh/ instead. In CV syllables, consonant was usually omitted or distorted. Tolerated tactile and gestural cueing around the mouth.

4. Final consonant awareness in CVC words during play
   - Used picture cards and toys to highlight final sounds in high-interest words (e.g., "cup," "dog," "bus"). Child frequently omitted final consonants in spontaneous speech. With imitation and focused listening tasks, could sometimes add a final /p/ or /m/, though productions were not yet consistent.

Plan / Recommendations:
- Continue to focus on establishing consistent /f/ and /s/ in isolation and simple syllables before advancing to word level.
- Encourage parent to model slow, clear productions at home and to highlight /f/ and /s/ sounds in familiar words (e.g., "fish," "sun") without asking for repeated corrections.
- Next session will revisit /f/ and /s/ isolation and CV/VC syllables, and continue to monitor final consonant production in play.`,

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother shared that she has been practicing the "lip-bite" sound in front of the mirror with her child. She feels the child is "trying more" but still not using the sound clearly in everyday words. No other concerns reported.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child separated from caregiver more easily this week and engaged quickly with preferred toys. Participated well in structured tasks for short bursts, then needed movement breaks. Responded positively to praise and visual stickers.

Goals / Therapy Activities:
1. /f/ in isolation and CV syllables
   - Notable improvement from last week. Child produced /f/ in isolation with moderate verbal and visual cues in most attempts. Fewer substitutions of /p/. In CV syllables ("fee," "fo," "fa"), accuracy was higher with slow modeling; child could imitate several clear productions in a row before fatigue. Still needed reminders to maintain airflow.

2. Initial /f/ in single words (imitation)
   - Trialed simple words (e.g., "fish," "fan," "foot") at the imitated word level. Child achieved some accurate productions, though consistency was variable. Tended to revert to /p/ when speaking more quickly ("pish" for "fish"). With segmenting and backward chaining (e.g., "ish" → "fish"), could correct with support. Emerging readiness to work at word level.

3. /s/ in isolation and simple syllables
   - Continued work on tongue placement using mirror and "snake sound" visual. Child showed more frequent successful /s/ productions in isolation with moderate cueing. In CV syllables ("see," "soo"), still some distortion but fewer /t/ substitutions. Required cues to keep tongue behind teeth.

4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)
   - Practiced final /p, m, t/ in simple CVC words ("cup," "mom," "hat") using picture cards. Child imitated several final consonants when directly prompted, with improved awareness compared to last week. Omission remained common in spontaneous play, but attempts to add endings were observed when cued.

Plan / Recommendations:
- Continue to strengthen /f/ production at the word level with imitation, while maintaining isolation and syllable practice for carryover.
- Maintain focus on /s/ isolation and CV syllables before moving to consistent word-level practice.
- Encourage parent to play short "sound games" at home (e.g., finding objects that start with /f/) and to praise attempts rather than perfection.`,

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother reported hearing a clearer "f" in a few words at home ("food," "five"), especially when she slowed down her own speech. She still notices dropped endings in many words but feels the child is "trying to fix" some sounds.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child entered the room independently and quickly gravitated toward a construction toy. Very engaged when therapy tasks were embedded into play. Needed occasional prompts to stay on topic but overall participation was good.

Goals / Therapy Activities:
1. Initial /f/ in single words (imitation → emerging spontaneous)
   - Targeted initial /f/ words ("fish, fan, feet, five, food") in a picture and game format. Child produced initial /f/ accurately in imitation much of the time with only light reminders to bite the lip. During structured play, began to produce some target words spontaneously with recognizable /f/ (e.g., "fish" without a model). Fewer /p/ substitutions compared to last week.

2. Initial /f/ in simple carrier phrases
   - Introduced short phrases such as "my fish," "big fan," and "two feet" using modeling and then faded supports. Child could imitate phrases with fairly clear /f/ when provided with a model. Independence at the phrase level is emerging but still variable.

3. /s/ in isolation and CV syllables; initial /s/ in word-level imitation
   - Child continued to show improved ability to sustain /s/ in isolation with moderate cues. Practiced CV syllables ("see, soo, suh"); accuracy better for "see" and "soo" than for "suh." Trialed a small set of initial /s/ words in imitation ("sun, soup, sock"). Productions were inconsistently accurate, with some /t/ substitutions and distorted /s/. Required visual and verbal cues for correct tongue placement.

4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)
   - Revisited final /p, m, t/ in CVC words using a turn-taking board game. Child more consistently added final /p/ and /m/ when directly imitating. Final /t/ remained more challenging, with occasional "tuh" additions. Still minimal carryover into spontaneous speech.

Plan / Recommendations:
- Continue to build consistency with initial /f/ at the word level and expand short carrier phrases.
- Maintain practice with /s/ in isolation and syllables, gradually increasing the number of initial /s/ words in imitation.
- Encourage parent to highlight and praise any clear /f/ words at home and to model simple two-word phrases with /f/ (e.g., "fun food").`,

    note_text: `Session 4

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother noted that her child is now using "fish" and "five" more clearly when counting or during bath time stories. She has not yet noticed much change in the /s/ sound. No new concerns.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child was cheerful and eager to show toys brought from home. Participated well in both play-based and table-top activities with brief movement breaks. Responded well to visual schedules and verbal praise.

Goals / Therapy Activities:
1. Initial /f/ in single words and short phrases
   - Child demonstrated increasing consistency with initial /f/ at the imitated word level. Words such as "fish, fan, feet, fork, food" were produced clearly most of the time with minimal cues. In short phrases ("my fish," "big fork," "two feet"), the child could imitate accurately and, during play, began to independently produce some phrases containing /f/ with recognizable clarity. Occasional reversion to /p/ occurred when speaking quickly.

2. /f/ in mixed positions at word level (emerging)
   - Introduced some final /f/ words ("off," "leaf") and medial /f/ ("sofa") in imitation. Child was able to approximate the sound but with less consistency than initial position. Required more direct modeling and slow pacing.

3. Initial /s/ in isolation, syllables, and limited word practice
   - Continued work on sustained /s/ in isolation; child now requires fewer prompts to maintain airflow. Practiced CV syllables and a small set of initial /s/ words ("sun, soup, sock, sand"). Accuracy at the imitated word level showed slight improvement: fewer /t/ substitutions, though distortions still present. Child responded to cues to keep tongue behind teeth and lips slightly apart.

4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation and listening tasks)
   - Reinforced awareness of final sounds with listening games ("Do you hear the end?"), followed by imitation of CVC words with /p, m, t/. Child showed similar performance to last week: more consistent with final /p/ and /m/, variable with /t/. Continued omission of final consonants in spontaneous utterances.

Plan / Recommendations:
- Continue to consolidate /f/ in initial position at word and short phrase levels, while gradually adding more words with /f/ in other positions.
- Maintain a small, functional set of /s/ words for practice and focus on improving accuracy through consistent tongue placement cues.
- Parent encouraged to model and expand phrases that include /f/ (e.g., "funny fish," "five feet"), and to gently repeat child's /s/ words with correct models without pressure to imitate every time.`,

    note_text: `Session 5

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother reported hearing more clear /f/ sounds during daily routines ("food," "four," "five"), particularly when she reminds the child to "bite your lip." She has not noticed much change in final consonants yet.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child transitioned smoothly into the session and was talkative and curious. Attention span for structured tasks was slightly longer today, with fewer prompts needed to stay engaged. Enjoyed turn-taking and simple competitive games.

Goals / Therapy Activities:
1. Initial /f/ in words and carrier phrases (imitation → increased independence)
   - Child produced initial /f/ with good consistency across a wider variety of words ("fish, fan, fun, fork, feet, food"). Accuracy remained high in imitation and is improving in short carrier phrases ("I see fish," "my fun fork"). Some independent phrase-level productions were observed during play with only minimal cueing.

2. /f/ in mixed positions at word level
   - Continued practice with final and medial /f/ ("off, leaf, coffee"). Child could imitate these with moderate success but required extra time to coordinate the final position. Tendency to drop the final /f/ when speaking quickly (e.g., "lea" for "leaf").

3. Initial /s/ in CV syllables and simple words (imitation)
   - Practiced CV syllables ("see, soo, say") and initial /s/ words ("sun, soup, sock, soap"). Slight increase in accuracy compared to prior sessions. Still some distortions and occasional /t/ substitutions, but the child responded to reminders to keep the tongue "behind the teeth" and to "make quiet air." Consistency is slowly improving but remains variable.

4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)
   - Revisited final /p, m, t/ using picture cards and a simple board game. Performance was similar to previous sessions: child could add final consonants in imitation in many trials, especially /p/ and /m/, but carryover into unstructured speech remains limited.

Plan / Recommendations:
- Continue to consolidate /f/ in initial position across more words and phrases, with ongoing practice in other word positions.
- Maintain focus on initial /s/ at the syllable and word levels with clear visual and verbal placement cues.
- Encourage parent to notice and praise clear /f/ words, and to model final consonants by slightly emphasizing them in key words (e.g., "cuP," "haT") without asking for constant repetitions.`,

    note_text: `Session 6

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother stated that the child continues to use clearer /f/ sounds in several familiar words, but she feels progress with /s/ and final sounds is "about the same" as last week. No concerns about hearing or overall health.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child appeared slightly tired at the start of the session but warmed up with a preferred toy. Participation in structured tasks was adequate, though more frequent breaks were needed. Cooperative and responsive to gentle redirection.

Goals / Therapy Activities:
1. Initial /f/ in words and short phrases
   - Performance remained generally stable relative to last week. Child continued to produce initial /f/ in a variety of words with good accuracy in imitation and moderate accuracy in short phrases. Occasional /p/ substitutions persisted when speaking quickly or when attention waned, but overall clarity for /f/ was maintained.

2. /f/ in mixed positions at word level
   - Practiced final and medial /f/ words ("off, leaf, coffee, muffin"). Accuracy was similar to prior session: child often produced clear /f/ in imitation when given time, but final /f/ was still frequently omitted in spontaneous attempts. No major change in cueing level was observed.

3. Initial /s/ in syllables and simple words (imitation)
   - Continued work with CV syllables and a core set of initial /s/ words ("sun, soup, sock, sand, seal"). Accuracy and error patterns were comparable to last week, with ongoing need for visual and verbal placement cues. Some isolated clearer productions were noted, but consistency did not yet show a marked shift.

4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)
   - Targeted final /p, m, t/ using play-based tasks. Child demonstrated similar performance to previous sessions: better success with /p/ and /m/, more difficulty with /t/. Omission of final consonants remained common in unstructured speech.

Plan / Recommendations:
- Continue current targets, allowing time for consolidation of /f/ and /s/ skills.
- Maintain a consistent set of high-frequency practice words for home and therapy.
- Parent encouraged to keep sessions at home short and fun, focusing on a few favorite /f/ and /s/ words rather than many new ones.`,

    note_number: 7,
    note_text: `Session 7

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother reported that the child has started to correct themselves occasionally on /f/ words (e.g., saying "pish...fish"). She has also noticed a few clearer /s/ words like "sun" during story time but says it is not yet consistent.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child was alert and engaged, quickly joining in both play and structured tasks. Demonstrated good turn-taking and enjoyed being the "teacher" to help the clinician "practice" sounds. Needed minimal redirection today.

Goals / Therapy Activities:
1. Initial /f/ in words and short phrases (increased independence)
   - Child showed more spontaneous use of clear /f/ during play ("fish," "food," "four," "five") with fewer substitutions. At the phrase level ("my fish," "four feet," "big food"), the child produced /f/ more independently, often needing only a brief reminder or visual cue. Emerging self-corrections were observed when the child initially produced /p/.

2. /f/ in mixed positions at word level
   - Continued practice with medial and final /f/ ("sofa, coffee, leaf, off"). The child showed slightly better consistency, particularly for final /f/ in imitation. Still more challenging than initial position, but improvement was noted in the child's ability to maintain airflow at the end of words.

3. Initial /s/ in syllables and simple words (imitation → emerging independence)
   - Practiced CV syllables and a familiar set of /s/ words ("sun, soup, sock, seal, sand"). Accuracy improved compared to previous weeks, with more consistently recognizable /s/ productions and fewer /t/ substitutions. The child occasionally produced a clearer /s/ word spontaneously during play (e.g., "sun") without direct prompting. Still benefits from visual and verbal cues, but less intensive cueing was required overall.

4. Final consonant production in CVC words (imitation)
   - Targeted final /p, m, t/ in game-based activities. The child continued to show better success with /p/ and /m/, with a slight increase in accurate /t/ endings when provided with a gesture cue. Final consonant omissions in spontaneous speech remained frequent but some attempts to add final sounds were noted.

Plan / Recommendations:
- Continue to strengthen independence with /f/ at word and short phrase levels, and gradually increase variety of /f/ words in different positions.
- Maintain focused practice on initial /s/ with an emphasis on building consistency and encouraging self-monitoring.
- Parent encouraged to point out and praise moments when the child corrects their own sounds and to keep modeling clear /s/ in daily routines.`,

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother shared that the child is now using clearer /f/ in many familiar words at home and that family members are commenting on improved clarity. She has heard a few better /s/ words ("sun," "sock") without reminders. She is interested in ways to help at the sentence level.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child entered the room enthusiastically and remained engaged throughout the session. Able to follow multi-step directions in play and was motivated by earning small rewards. Demonstrated good persistence even when tasks were more challenging.

Goals / Therapy Activities:
1. /f/ in sentences and structured conversation
   - Expanded from short phrases to simple sentences containing /f/ (e.g., "I see a fish," "The food is hot," "Four funny frogs"). Child produced /f/ with high accuracy in imitation and increasing independence when retelling short stories or describing pictures. Spontaneous use of /f/ in connected speech during play was clear in many instances, with only occasional /p/ substitutions.

2. /f/ in mixed word positions within phrases
   - Practiced phrases and short sentences with /f/ in initial, medial, and final positions ("soft leaf," "big coffee cup," "take it off"). Child handled initial /f/ with minimal support; medial and final /f/ remained slightly less consistent but showed improvement. Able to maintain airflow better at the end of words when cued to "keep the air going."

3. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases (imitation → early spontaneous use)
   - Targeted initial /s/ words ("sun, soup, sock, sand, seal, soap") in games and picture tasks. Accuracy at the imitated word level was notably better than earlier sessions, with more consistent /s/ productions. Introduced short carrier phrases ("my sun," "see sock"). Child could imitate these phrases with fair accuracy and occasionally produced clear /s/ words spontaneously during play. Still benefits from reminders about tongue placement, but overall cueing demands were reduced.

4. Final consonant production in CVC words and short phrases (imitation)
   - Continued work on final /p, m, t/ in CVC words and short phrases ("big cup," "my mom," "red hat"). Child showed gradual improvement, particularly when words were practiced repeatedly in a meaningful context. However, omissions in spontaneous speech remained common, suggesting ongoing need for structured practice.

Plan / Recommendations:
- Continue to expand /f/ into more complex sentences and monitor generalization into less structured conversation.
- Maintain a targeted set of /s/ words and phrases, gradually increasing phrase complexity as accuracy stabilizes.
- Parent encouraged to use simple picture books or routines (e.g., snack time) to elicit short sentences with /f/ and to gently model clearer /s/ in familiar /s/ words.`,

    note_text: `Session 9

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother reported that the child continues to use strong /f/ sounds in sentences at home ("I found four frogs") and that this feels "pretty consistent now." She has heard some clearer /s/ words but still finds /s/ less reliable. No new concerns.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child remained cooperative and chatty throughout the session. Needed a brief movement break midway but quickly re-engaged with tasks. Enjoyed being given choices about which pictures and games to use.

Goals / Therapy Activities:
1. /f/ in sentences and conversation
   - Performance remained stable with good accuracy for /f/ in sentences and structured conversation. Child produced /f/ correctly in a variety of contexts with minimal to no cueing. Occasional errors occurred when speaking very quickly, but the child was usually understood.

2. /f/ in mixed positions across phrases
   - Continued to practice /f/ in initial, medial, and final positions within short sentences. Accuracy was consistent with previous session; child required minimal reminders for final /f/. No notable change in cueing needs this week.

3. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases
   - Revisited the same core /s/ words and short phrases ("sun, soup, sock, seal, sand"; "my sun," "see sock"). Accuracy was similar to last week: child produced more correct /s/ sounds in imitation and some spontaneous words, but consistency varied. Visual and verbal cues were still helpful, particularly when the child became excited.

4. Final consonant production in CVC words and phrases
   - Practiced final /p, m, t/ in play (e.g., feeding animals "cup," "ham," "hat"). Child continued to show improving awareness but still omitted final sounds frequently in spontaneous speech. Performance at the imitated level was comparable to the prior session.

Plan / Recommendations:
- Maintain current level of practice for /f/ to support generalization and monitor for continued stability.
- Continue structured work on initial /s/ and final consonants, allowing more time for these skills to consolidate.
- Parent encouraged to keep noticing and reinforcing clear /f/ and /s/ productions and to provide gentle models for final consonants without high pressure.`,

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother stated that speech overall seems easier to understand for familiar listeners, mainly due to the clearer /f/ sounds. She feels /s/ and word endings are "about the same" as last week. Child recently started a new preschool routine; no concerns reported from teachers yet.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child initially talked a lot about preschool but settled into therapy tasks with minimal support. Remained engaged in both table-top and floor activities. Showed good willingness to attempt harder words when encouraged.

Goals / Therapy Activities:
1. /f/ in sentences and conversation
   - Continued practice of /f/ in connected speech. Child maintained high accuracy with /f/ across initial, medial, and final positions in sentences. Very little cueing was required, and errors were infrequent. Performance remained stable.

2. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases
   - Practiced a familiar set of /s/ words and added a few new ones ("sun, soup, sock, seal, sand, soap, seat"). The child showed similar accuracy to the previous session, with some correct productions and some distortions or substitutions. Cueing level remained about the same; visual and verbal reminders continued to be beneficial.

3. Initial /s/ in structured play (emerging spontaneous use)
   - Embedded /s/ targets into a pretend play scenario (e.g., setting up a "sand" area, washing with "soap"). Child produced a few clearer /s/ words spontaneously but also reverted to less accurate productions. No significant shift in independence was noted this week.

4. Final consonant production in CVC words
   - Continued with CVC words and short phrases emphasizing final /p, m, t/. The child's performance was comparable to recent sessions: increased success with final consonants in imitation, but spontaneous use of final sounds remained limited. No major change in overall pattern.

Plan / Recommendations:
- Maintain focus on consolidating /s/ at word and short phrase levels while continuing to monitor stable /f/ skills.
- Continue final consonant work in highly functional words that are relevant at preschool (e.g., "hat," "cup," "bus").
- Parent encouraged to check in with preschool staff about any intelligibility concerns and to share strategies (e.g., slowing down, repeating key words) if needed.`,

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother reported that preschool staff have mentioned that the child is generally understandable but sometimes "drops the ends" of words. They also occasionally notice unclear /s/ sounds. Mother feels skills are "holding steady" since last week.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child came in with good energy and quickly engaged in pretend play. Cooperative throughout the session with only brief redirection needed. Enjoyed using a mirror to "watch" sounds.

Goals / Therapy Activities:
1. /f/ in conversation and carryover tasks
   - Used open-ended conversation and picture description tasks. Child continued to produce /f/ accurately in most contexts without cues. Occasional slips occurred but did not significantly affect intelligibility. Performance stable compared to prior weeks.

2. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases
   - Practiced a mix of familiar and new /s/ words ("sun, soup, sock, seal, sand, seat, soup, sad"). Accuracy remained similar to the last session. Child responded well when reminded to place the tongue "behind the teeth," but still needed these cues fairly often. Phrase-level accuracy ("my sock," "see sun") was variable.

3. Initial /s/ in structured play
   - Embedded /s/ targets into a board game and pretend play. Child produced some spontaneous /s/ words with clearer articulation, but these were interspersed with less accurate productions. Overall level of independence was consistent with recent weeks.

4. Final consonant production in CVC words and short phrases
   - Continued focus on final /p, m, t/ in high-frequency words. Child could produce final consonants reliably in imitation within structured tasks but omitted them more frequently when shifting to brief phrases or unstructured play. Error patterns and cueing needs were stable.

Plan / Recommendations:
- Continue with current targets, emphasizing consistent placement cues for /s/ and gradual increase in phrase-level practice.
- Maintain collaboration with preschool staff to support carryover (e.g., modeling clear /s/ and final sounds during small group activities).
- Parent encouraged to continue brief, fun practice at home and to reinforce when the child uses clearer /s/ or final consonants in everyday situations.`,

Parent/Caregiver Report:
- Mother reported that the child's speech remains easier to understand than at the start of the block, particularly with /f/. She notes that /s/ and final consonants are still "a work in progress" but feels the child is more aware of sounds. No new concerns.

Behaviour/Engagement:
- Child was relaxed and talkative, transitioning easily into therapy activities. Participated well in both structured and play-based tasks. Demonstrated good rapport with the clinician and responded well to feedback.

Goals / Therapy Activities:
1. Review of /f/ across word positions in conversation
   - Conducted a review of /f/ in initial, medial, and final positions during picture description and conversational tasks. Child maintained strong accuracy for /f/ with minimal cueing required. Occasional errors were self-corrected. This skill appears well established at this time.

2. Initial /s/ in words and short phrases
   - Revisited core /s/ words and short phrases ("sun, soup, sock, seal, sand," "see sun," "my sock"). Performance was consistent with recent sessions: a mix of accurate and distorted /s/ productions, with better accuracy when the child was attentive and used placement cues. Still needs regular reminders for tongue position but is increasingly tolerant of cueing.

3. Initial /s/ in simple sentences (imitation)
   - Introduced short sentences with /s/ in initial position (e.g., "The sun is hot," "I see soup"). Child could imitate these sentences with fair accuracy when provided with a clear model and slowed rate. Independence at the sentence level is not yet established, but the child managed several recognizable productions.

4. Final consonant production in functional CVC words
   - Targeted final /p, m, t/ in functional words used at home and preschool ("cup, nap, mom, game, hat, seat"). In imitation, the child produced many accurate final consonants. Spontaneous carryover remains limited but awareness of final sounds appears improved, as the child occasionally attempted to "add the end" when cued.

Plan / Recommendations:
- Recommend continued therapy to further develop /s/ accuracy and final consonant production, with a focus on increasing independence at the phrase and sentence levels.
- Provide parent with a short list of high-frequency /s/ words and CVC words with final consonants for home practice, emphasizing brief, positive practice times.
- Plan next block to prioritize /s/ refinement and final consonant carryover, while monitoring maintenance of strong /f/ skills in connected speech.`,
